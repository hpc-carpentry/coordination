# HPC Carpentries Coworking Hours: 12 November

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday, with three time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. Times are subject to change, after discussion & voting via GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues), so please speak up (or open a new issue) if you are unable to attend due to permanent conflicts with the existing time slots.

Check your local times below, and join whichever is most convenient.

Thanks, and see you soon!

  - Trevor says:

    > https://shellshare.net has come up a few times in Carpentries discussions. The advantage is that it's local to your machine, so the config & environment you generally use will be reflected.
    >
    > If you need to record, https://asciinema.org is the go-to, except it doesn't feature audio.
    > https://github.com/dhobsd/castty may be a better bet for that.

### Agenda & Notes

* Task Force Coordination Meeting is next *Tuesday*.
  - TK: a bit troubled that we've fragmented into 3 separate meetings. Hard to coordinate.
  - AR: Most of the agenda items are collecting data, which can be asynch. December meeting should be a consolidated gathering.
* <https://www.hpc-carpentry.org> (<https://github.com/ocaisa/hpc-carpentry.org>)
    - Alan suggested transferring the repo to HPC Carpentry. Votes have all been "thumbs up."
* Progress on artwork &rarr; [awesome options from @annajiat's students](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/28)

* Blog post(s) or newsletter before next week's meeting?
    * TK will endeavor to consolidate the past month's Coworking Hours notes into a blog post
* Options for recording practice / demo lessons?
    - Lookin' at https://github.com/dhobsd/castty
    - Can also use Open Broadcaster, if the config is not daunting to you.

* Start reviewing older issues to see whether they've been addressed, and consolidating the open ones
