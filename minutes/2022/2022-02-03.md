# HPCC Coworking Hours: 3 February 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite
- Trevor Keller
- Alan O'Cais

### Agenda with Minutes

> For the sake of clarity, please take notes _directly inline_ with the agenda,
> rather than in a separate section. Thanks!

#### Work on Issues

There are a number of actionable issues from the SC'21 BoF, collected in a
[Milestone](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/milestone/1). Let's
work on resolving as many as we can.

#### Site Structure

There are new templates for building Carpentries workshops, so our site will
need to be reworked for these. We could take this opportunity to simplify the
snippet library, maybe narrow the focus to just PBS and Slurm. How important is
it to have the queue/partition names match the system? This is high-value for
maintaining lesson flow and not having to stop to explain why they differ, but
there is a cost that's incurred at workshop set-up time.

#### Coding vs Black-box examples

Some workshops that have more time might want to explore how the parallel codes
actually work, and demonstrate the effect of code changes on performance. This
is a gateway to performance tuning, which is a very large space, and general
lessons may be hard to impart.

In an example that was actually done, the task was random-number generation,
which the profiler revealed to be most expensive part of the Python example.
Learners worked through code changes in Python, C, Java, and assembler.

- [gprof](http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/) for serial code
- [TAU](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php) in parallel

Profiling can come early in our lesson sequence so that learners can see the
benefit of the HPC resource and parallelization, but tuning is possibly an
advanced topic, especially if it's going to get into instruction-set details.

Related, conversion of
[HPC Intro issue #362](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/362)
to a PR is underway.

- HPC Intro:

  - Why use a cluster? (20 minutes)
  - Working on a remote HPC system (35 minutes)
  - Working with the scheduler (1 hour 15 minutes)
  - Accessing software via Modules (45 minutes)
  - Transferring files with remote computers (30 minutes)
  - Running a parallel job (1 hour) : currently this uses MPI4PY to calculate
    PI, this should be replaced with Amdahl's law example
  - Using resources effectively (40 minutes)
  - Using shared resources responsibly (20 minutes)
  - File sytem performance and appropriateness for different jobs?

- HPC Parallel Novice:
  - Pi calculation
  - Serial Profiling
  - Parallelization with MPI4PY
  - Parallel profiling TAU and/or other tools
  - C or Fortran parallel code, discuss speed, compute bound vs bandwidth
    bound, roofline, thread latency
  - Discussion on generated assembly, possibly inspired by
    https://github.com/TeachingUndergradsCHC/modules/tree/master/Architecture/arm_introduction
- HPC Intermediate:
  - Performance optimization?

#### Feedback on the jargon-buster

Jargon-busting presentation is in
[PR #377](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/377). Dry run
presented at the meeting. It might be useful to better differentiate the
"cloud" and "cluster" examples with a picture of the topology of the cluster,
to emphasize the relative uniformity of the compute resources as opposed to the
cloud.

### Profiling Tools

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller
- Andrew Reid
- Wirawan Purwanto (he), ODU

### Agenda with Minutes

#### Jargon Busting

(Andrew & Trevor are still updating this. )

#### Plug: Release of the DeapSECURE "Big Data" Lesson to the Community

New lesson on big data & Pandas? -->
<https://deapsecure.gitlab.io/deapsecure-lesson02-bd/>

Source: https://gitlab.com/deapsecure/deapsecure-lesson02-bd/

This is fully released with the standard Carpentries-style open source licenses
(CC-BY & MIT). Please take a look and give comment, feedback, teach the lesson,
etc; reuse portions that you find useful!

(FIXME BUG: The edit link on the published lesson doesn't work yet)(says
"GitHub", links to GitLab, but 404's)

> DeapSECURE also produces a developer's repository (one per lesson with
> exception of ML & NN which are merged) that is going to be released later.
> That is our kitchen with experimental files, hands-on "source files", etc.

For all of our six lesson modules, check out the project's main site:
<https://deapsecure.gitlab.io/> . The goal is to release all six of them by the
end of Summer. Contact Wirawan Purwanto
([github@wirawan0](https://github.com/wirawan0) or
[gitlab@wirawan0](https://gitlab.com/wirawan0)) for more information.

Note that DeapSECURE does have a specific philosophy in the development of the
lesson: (quoted from https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3332247)

1. Motivate the [computational] technique to the students by drawing real-world
   examples from state-of-the-art cybersecurity research;
2. Leverage real data sets, such as data generated by cybersecurity researchers
   and practitioners;
3. Emphasize practical tools and adopt a “concept-by-example” approach; this is
   in contrast to the ground-up approach usually employed in standard
   curriculum courses.

**Potential relevance with HPC Carpentry**: the big data lesson is actually
doable on local machine unless your data is huge. But the other lessons at one
point does require HPC, batch job scheduling toward the end of the lesson(s),
so those could become nice exercises for HPC Carpentry uses.
