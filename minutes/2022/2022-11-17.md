# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 17 November 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### The Road To The Carpentries

On Nov. 14, several of the steering-committee folks had a very excellent
meeting with Erin Becker, Associate Director of the Carpentries and Membership
Team lead.

The notes from
[that meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/h4bbHqmuQcCJ3jDeyUSx6A) are
available.

The consensus of opinion was that, notwithstanding some concerns we have,
there's no reason not to take the step of formally applying to the Carpentries
for approval to enter the lesson incubation phase, as laid out in the
curriculum manual.

This meeting's agenda primary item is to draft the report that answers the
questions spelled out in the manual (see below).

It is worth emphasizing that the level of formality is perhaps lower than you
might guess from just looking at the list -- this process is relatively new,
and we are the first to exercise it, so there will likely be a certain amount
of back-and-forth to ensure that everyone is comfortable with moving forward.

The items to hit in the report are in the notes, and are repeated below:

> As the Lesson Project develops and undertakes the activities listed above in
> the Pre-incubation Phase, it may consider applying for Incubation as an
> official Carpentries Lesson Program. Application for Incubation requires the
> submission of a report from the Lesson Project that must include:
>
> 1. Description of the community that is working on the Lesson Project
> 2. Description of domain knowledge required for instructors to teach the
>    material, so that we can determine to what extent our existing instructor
>    pool may possess these skills and be able to teach these workshops
> 3. Description of the community that the Lesson Project serves with their
>    workshops
> 4. Goals of the Lesson Project
> 5. List of the lessons developed or under development and what a two-day
>    workshop would include, along with access to the materials for Carpentries
>    review
> 6. Information about when and where at least some of the materials have been
>    taught, even if as smaller modules and not yet a full-fledged 2-day
>    workshop
> 7. Assessment information from the teaching events regarding number of
>    attendees and learner feedback about the workshop(s), either using The
>    Carpentries standard surveys or custom survey questions
> 8. How the Lesson Project feels that becoming an official Carpentries Lesson
>    Program will benefit the Lesson Project, The Carpentries, and the broader
>    learning community.

- Toby suggested that this is perhaps a good opportuntity to reach out the
  Carpentries discuss list and ask for feedback on who has taught our lessons
  and if they can contribute something to allow us to make this proposal. It
  will also help gather a list of potential instructors.

### Other Business

We still have other tasks flying around, these are certainly in scope for this
meeting if time permits.

## 1200 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM
- Benson Muite (he/him), Kichakato Kizito

#### Recap of the Monday meeting

Generally summarized the Monday meeting, elaborating a bit on the Codi notes.

Carpentries action items from the meeting were:

- For Toby, answer the question about what, practically speaking, is meant by
  the linguistic and geographic diversity goals for the various committees. The
  nominal structure is a "Governance committee" that focuses on high-level
  strategy and goals for the effort, and a "Curriculum advisory committee"
  which is focused on curriculum-specific matters. Roughly speaking, the
  Governance group does not go into development mode, and the Curriculum group
  does. If we kept our current structure, with just the one committee doing
  both, this would be a deviation from the nominal plan, but if it meets the
  goals, it would probably be OK.
- For Jason Williams, advice about the pros and cons of having a standardized,
  cloud-capable resource that lessons can target in a uniform way, vs.
  customizeable lessons that can be adapted to specific local resources that
  are more relevant to the audience that a particular institution will want to
  focus on.
- For us, the agenda item here -- craft an application narrative that answers
  the questions from the curriculum guide.

#### Curriculum management

Non-core content could drift out of functionality due to bit-rot and lack of
maintenance, we should be aware that this can happen.

An earlier attempt to retire the Chapel lesson brought out someone who was
maintaining it, but was busy and didn't have a ton of bandwidth for
contributions. We want to stay in touch with these folks, but on the other
hand, it does make the portfolio tend towards untidyness and a lack of
coordination. Unclear how much of a liability that is.

The Chapel lesson is maintained and will likely be developed further. It is
taught at least once a year. Will reach out to maintainer to determine
involvment with community.

#### How to Actually Proceed

Assembling our answers to the "who has taught our lessons" is an excellent
opportunity to reach out to all the various forks, advise them that we are
applying for Carpentries incubator status, and get feedback from them on how
they've used the material, what feedback they may have, and possibly encourage
them to re-connect with us so they, too, can enjoy the benefits of Carpentries
affiliation.

Create a shared document and start hacking on it. Benson will create a ~~Google
Doc~~ Git repo, we'll use that.

- No no, we really want a Google Doc this time! Track changes/comments are
  important features.
- Git has tracking and discussion features.
- True, but after a few minutes' discussion in the meeting, Google Docs emerged
  as the clear winner: platform is really not up for debate.
