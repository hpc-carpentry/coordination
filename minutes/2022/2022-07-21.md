# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 21 July 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

- We made three submissions to [CarpentryCon](https://2022.carpentrycon.org/),
  detailed in the
  [June 2 co-working document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/SNAju8Y5R_aVCbc_pBkbAw).
  This meeting's agenda is about preparations for the conference, now that
  these have been accepted. The sprint is probably the most complicated,
  benefitting from close contact with the
  [SnakeMake](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics/)
  team.
  - For the lightning talk, the recording was nominally due July 18. As of this
    writing, Trevor had asked for an extension, expected to submit the 19th or
    20th. Hopeflly by now this has happened -- early deadline is to allow time
    to caption the talks.
  - For the other talks, we have been asked to upload materials to the
    appropriate folder of the Google Drive (links in e-mails) by July 27.
  - For the Breakout, there is outreach to be done to try to get the right
    people in the room for maximum benefit in figuring out the pathway to the
    carpentries.
    - People who've done this before -- Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry?
    - Carpentries curriculum development folks (Hi Toby!)
    - People who run workshops and can ID pain points between what they usually
      do and we would require (obvious focus on cluster set-up)
  - For the sprints, setting and advertising feasible goals, and setting a
    reasonable agenda for each of the sessions.

## 1100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Wirawan Purwanto - listening

### Lightning Talk

Not yet submitted, but CarpentryCon organizers are aware, current deadline is
July 22 (tomorrow as I write this).

Invested some time in outlining a script for this, as it's more urgent than the
other CarpentryCon items. Found the Sc21 BoF slides, which can offer more of a
running start to this process.

#### Outline

1. Title slide
2. Target Audience and Relationship to other Carpentries Lessons
3. Why should you care?
4. What is HPC?
5. History
6. Next steps
7. How to get involved

### Breakout ([14:00 UTC, 4 August 2022](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NjBncXJxcnUwZjNnazJzbW9xcjdnN2Zjbm4gY190bXRya2YzMjhnanRjczF1MDVtaGZibjdxY0Bn&ctz=Europe/Berlin))

- Who should be there? (LC team at the time:
  https://librarycarpentry.org/team/)

  - Tim Dennis, for perspective and history of Library Carpentry joining The
    Carpentries as a new Lesson Program
  - Toby Hodges
  - Executive council program committee
    https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info#program-committee
    - Annajiat Alim Rasel
    - Amel Ghoulia (Chair of Program Committee)
    - Sarah Stevens (Chair of Executive Council)
  - Administration
    - SherAaron (Sher!) Hurt, Workshop Administration Team Lead
    - Erin Becker, Associate Director - Library Carpentry merger process
  - Other lessons/applications
    - Singularity lesson developers
    - GPU lesson developers

- Confirmed participants
- Cluster availability, how make administration easier
  - Want to also enable similar infrastructure for big data/cloud lessons
- Community and governance
- Sustainability
  - The Carpentries wants to ensure that there is community [of contributors]
    around the lessons that will sustain, further develop/improve that lessons,
    not that everybody thinks that since this is now under the Carpentries,
    they just "let the Carpentries do it".
- Roadmap
  - May help people who want to join the community later, to decide if this is
    something they want to get involved in.

### Sprint

- Does Snakemake lesson require Python as a prerequisite?

  - Recommend, but not require Python
  - Reasoning: It's "snakemake" language which has some Python in it, but not
    quite "Python"

- Do we want to insist on Snakemake?

  - There is always a hater for every tool we plan to teach
  - The idea is to expose learners to the concept of "workflow management";
    after learning the lesson, the learners can choose other tools that suit
    their use cases best.

- Plan: Use matplotlib to visualize computational result
  - May need to settle with "graybox" Python scripts to reduce distraction from
    the focus of the lesson, in the same way we use a graybox code ("Amdahls")
    in hpc-intro
  - Why prefer Matplotlib? It builds on knowledge on Python (+matplotlib)
    already taught in other Carpentries' lessons
  - Alternative 1: Mayavi. Nice, but heavy in prerequisites.
  - Alternative 2: GNUplot may be a reasonable alternative since it is widely
    available on Linux installs
  - Alternative 3: https://github.com/sciapp/gr

#### More importantly, how are we preparing folks for the sprint?

- Introduction to the lesson repo layout, what files to edit
- Branching workflows & issues
- Prepare a Primer document that covers these topics
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Testing for spelling, etc.

## 2100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Mike Renfro (he/him), TN Tech University
- Rhys Kerley (he/him), TN Tech University

### Review of the 1100 UTC session

General satisfaction with the earlier session's decisions.

- Snakemake is well-integrated across many Carpentries lessons, we should keep
  it for the foreseeable.
- Matplotlib is the right plotting tool for our environment, it's appropriately
  pythonic

An option for educational cluster deployment is to stand up a cluster on
someone's local machine, so more central than everyone for themselves on their
laptops, but without requiring cloud resources. There are various ways to do
this, including a nifty tool from
[University of Buffalo Center for Computational Research](https://github.com/ubccr/hpc-toolset-tutorial),
which uses Open OnDemand and other familiar tools.
