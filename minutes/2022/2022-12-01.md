# HPCC Coworking Hours: 1 December 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

The Carpentries' [Lesson Development Handbook][ldh] requests that the
application document cover the following items _at a minimum_. Including this
list at the end, with links back to the relevant clauses, would be helpful.
Answering in the form of an itemized list would not be.

1. Description of the community that is working on the Lesson Project
2. Description of domain knowledge required for instructors to teach the
   material, so that we can determine to what extent our existing instructor
   pool may possess these skills and be able to teach these workshops
3. Description of the community that the Lesson Project serves with their
   workshops
4. Goals of the Lesson Project
5. List of the lessons developed or under development and what a two-day
   workshop would include, along with access to the materials for Carpentries
   review
6. Information about when and where at least some of the materials have been
   taught, even if as smaller modules and not yet a full-fledged 2-day workshop
7. Assessment information from the teaching events regarding number of
   attendees and learner feedback about the workshop(s), either using The
   Carpentries standard surveys or custom survey questions
8. How the Lesson Project feels that becoming an official Carpentries Lesson
   Program will benefit the Lesson Project, The Carpentries, and the broader
   learning community.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- _name & pronouns, affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries (~~tbyhdgs~~ **tobyhodges** on GitLab)

### Lesson Program Incubator

<https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request>

Some discussion about format and logistics. Consensus was that the existing
[Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request) is the
primary shared document for composing the application, and that we will stick
with Markdown as our "source code" for the purpose of this project.

Andrew thinks this should not be a heavy lift to get a document prepared, and
that the hardest part of the problem will be reaching out to the various forks
of the lesson and getting feedback from them that we might want to incorporate
into the pitch.

Outreach folks likely include the Chapel lesson maintainer. Benson says we
already have some preliminary feedback from Callum in Australia, who is
teaching HPC intro and the container lesson.

#### Issues with the current content

- The "domain of knowledge required for instructors" question is not really
  answered in the current version (question #2).
- The lessons are not explicitly listed, though they are described (question
  #5).
- Info about when/where the material has been taught is not in the current
  version (question #6).
- Assessment information from teaching events has not yet been collated
  (question #7).

Somewhere in the narrative, we should be sure to include adjacent activities
that we're aware of and that is in use, like:

- the Chapel lesson (Mature)
- the container materials (Nesi can take a lead on maintaining this)
- the GPU material (Optional inclusion)

From the point of view of describing the community, the activities of the
antipodeans (Callum and the Nesi folks) is relevant insofar as they have built
on our material, and they have an infrastructure that facilitates sending
changes back upstream, which could be a good model for other communities. This
is a bit double-edged, as they have not in fact contributed back, but they are
definitely part of the community.

Generally speaking, we should capture the various forks and their relationship
(if any) to the "upstream".

There may be an opportunity with some parallel R material, for which there have
been Carpentries-like workshops. These folks may also be candidates for a
future curriculum advisory committee.-

#### TODO:

- Identify the various forks. Contact the fork owners and get feedback from
  them, decide how to represent these in the community description. (Relevant
  to question #3, and #6 and #7.)
- Make a list of all the lessons, including lessons we own and lessons derived
  from what we own. (Answers question #5) (Include ODU's Deapsecure effort, Big
  Data)
- Include narrative content that answers Q#2. This will vary across lessons.
- Figure out a governance and lesson improvement model that will work for more
  HPC people who may attend fewer meetings, but will review and teach material.
  Relevant to Q#8 in that it's a benefit of becoming a Carpentries activity.
  Also relevant to the impedance mismatch between our lesson structure and
  typical Carpentries lesson structure. (Snippets!)
- Describe the history better -- emphasize continuity across leadership changes
  (departure of Steinbach and Koch), affiliation with Compute Canada.
- Identify candidates (from the diaspora?) for a possible future curriculum
  advisory committee.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), ODU
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Lesson Program Incubator

### Other Business

Discussion about possible follow-up from SC22 -- Wirawan was there.

- Historically speaking there has been funding from NSF for (US-based) training
  (i.e. XSEDE, BlueWaters), but a lot of this has dried up. ACCESS (successor
  of XSEDE) does not have this, although they have made some promises about the
  future.

- Wirawan also met with people in the SIGHPC education chapter.

  - We should consider partnering with them.

- There was a Chapel BOF, impression is that the maturity of the language has
  improved significantly, probably our lesson is out of date.

  - We might want to visit Chapel lesson and consider whether that is a
    next-level target after HPC Workflow is fairly completed.
