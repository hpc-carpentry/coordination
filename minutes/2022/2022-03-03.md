# HPCC Coworking Hours: 3 March 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

### Agenda

> _N.B.:_ Coworking hours are intended to serve as a block of time to work on
> HPC Carpentries materials, esp. editing the lessons and addressing open pull
> requests and issues. Unless it's urgent, discussion of new topics should be
> reserved for the Coordination Meetings.

#### Refactor HPC Intro

[<i class="fa fa-github"></i> @stoltzstrop](https://github.com/stoltzstrop)
contributed [pull request (#386)][gpu-pr] to HPC Intro: a well-written and
detailed episode on GPU computing with the `pi.py` code as a motivating
example.
[Like adding a neutron to Tellurium-130](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131#Production),
HPC Intro has crossed into fissile territory and it's time to thoughtfully
break apart (I-131 is an important medical radioisotope).

This exercise has two goals:

1. Adjust the endpoints of the current episodes to encapsulate some common
   theme or scope.
2. Separate these episodes into Morning and Afternoon clusters to form the
   first day of a complete HPC Carpentry workshop.

Doing so will produce a tidier lesson with a larger number of episodes, which
will improve modularity. The vision is to create a "default" workshop, with all
of the episodes of HPC Intro taught in sequence. By editing `_config.yml`, a
workshop organizer can choose which episodes to include in their fork in order
to match the expertise of the learners.

Note that the intent here is not necessarily to merge [#386][gpu-pr],
unfortunately: GPU computing is not obviously-in-scope for an _introductory_
HPC lesson. Instead, the aim is to improve the clarity of scope, and probably
launch a separate *hpc-intermediate *lesson or lessons covering topics beyond
basic scheduler usage and scaling studies.

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries

### Notes

What should HPC Intro be?

- [name=Andrew] prereq: shell. It should cover queueing systems, moving from
  "what is a queuing system" to a scaling study.
  - Using a black-box code
  - Anything that isn't within scope belongs somewhere else:
    - MPI in Python, etc.
    - Analyzing performance
- [name=Benson]: yes, add versions for AWS, ...

  - It would be nice to use the GPU material from Netherlands eScience Center;
    its pycuda focused
  - Move pi into a parallel programming lesson
    - Parallel Novice is focused on dask; emphasize _data_ in title?
    - Create a parallel-novice-programming lesson for `pi.py`

- [name=Toby]: there's value in documenting what we have and which lessons
  "hang together" as a cohesive workshop, and which extra lessons would tend to
  lose novices but would be useful as stand-alone or intermediate workshop
  materials.
- Action Item: add a "suggested workshop sequence" page to the website
  - Shell Novice (morning 1)
  - HPC Intro (afternoon 1)
  - HPC Data (morning 2)
  - HPC Programming (afternoon 2)
  - Singularity (starting with Docker)
- [name=Toby]:
  - it's reasonable to say people who have had a SWC workshop with shell, git,
    python recently will be well-prepared for HPC.
  - HPC Intro does not depend on git or python, so there's a nice synergy in
    kicking off an HPC workshop with the stock Shell material
  - Be careful that HPC learners are not overwhelmed by the shell, and make
    sure that we're meeting their needs: don't blitz Shell if people need that
    pace & scope of introduction.
- [name=Benson]: most learners at past workshops have IDE experience, coming
  from Windows: not much shell.
- [name=Andrew]: kids these days have no concept of The POSIX Filesystem
  Hierarchy.

- [name=Benson]: Basically, we have 1.5 days of material.

Breaking up HPC Intro episodes into more cohesive modules...

- [name=Toby]: lesson outcomes & objectives should be used when rewriting, to
  audit changes & make sure there's deliberate decisionmaking about what to
  keep and what moves to a separate lesson (and which).
  - First step should be auditing the objectives we have.
  - Review whether the material in each episode aligns with the objectives
  - Update the objectives, or remove material that is not aligned (to another
    repo, preferably)
  - Invite Jeremy Cohen (Uni College London) to weigh in on Singularity things;
    responsible for professional development for RSEs.

What to do with the extra half-day?

- Singularity/Docker!
- [name=Toby]: From a workshop facilitation perspective, it helps if there's an
  infrastructure The Carpentries can help spin up. That's Singularity.
- [name=Andrew]: Docker is useful for dependency management. In the scalable
  web service world, it works well. Elsewhere, it's not well adapted; almost by
  accident, Docker resolves package management woes, but its tradeoffs make it
  more of a mistake to use outside of web stuff.
- [name=Toby]:
  > For reproducible research, Docker for environment/dependency management is
  > definitely an accurate description.
  >
  > An _HPC_ Carpentry workshop should teach Singularity. A Container Carpentry
  > workshop would teach Docker.

### Action Items

1. All: take notes on the current Objectives and Outcomes of HPC Intro and its
   episodes.
   - Are the skills in keeping with our current notion of the scope?
   - Is the material in keeping with the skills & scope?
   - Do objectives need to be added or revised?
   - Does material need to be expanded or removed?
2. [name=Trevor]  
   add a "suggested workshop sequences" page to the website
   - Intro Workshop
     1. Shell Novice (morning 1)
     1. HPC Intro (afternoon 1 + morning 2)
     1. Singularity (afternoon 2)
   - Advanced Workshops (modular)
     1. Big Data on HPC (morning 1)
     1. HPC Programming Intro (afternoon 1)
     1. MPI Programming (morning 2)
     1. GPU Programming (afternoon 2)
3. [name=Trevor] -- Propose migrating hpc-parallel-novice to The Incubator
4. [name=Benson] -- create a Parallel Programming lesson
   - _N.B.:_ The Carpentries
     [**_Curriculum Development Handbook_**](https://cdh.carpentries.org)
   - Propose renaming _hpc-parallel-novice_ to _hpc-parallel-data_ or
     _hpc-python-data_
   - Propose (or do) a new lesson on HPC Programming, using the current
     _hpc-intro_ as its basis
     - Clone _hpc-intro_ as the basis of a new _hpc-parallel-programming_
       lesson, centered around `pi.py`
       - Objectives: basics of MPI (comm, rank, scatter/gather)
       - Language of choice will still be Python?
       - Is _hpc-parallel-python_ an appropriate name, in terms of clarity &
         scope?
         - _hpc-python-programming_ vs. _hpc-python-data_ perhaps?
     - Request @stoltzstrop open a new PR against the new repo based on the
       [GPU PR][gpu-pr]
     - update README, refine scope of the new lesson
     - Revise learning objectives & outcomes: what skills will thelesson teach?

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto

### Agenda

1. Discuss the earlier meeting's [action items](#Action-Items).
2. Work on [coordination/105: Lesson Objectives & Outcomes
   Review][lesson-objectives].

### Notes

#### Observation of UNIX shell/CLI skills on HPC users

Largely depends on community.

Experience in university setting today (Wirawan):

- People coming from a research group with strong tech culture (e.g. using
  Linux desktop, using UNIX toolchains, etc)---they will get onboarded by their
  in-group interactions.
- However we see more and more people without CLI skills/experience. Most are
  from disciplines that are not well-rooted in HPC yet. They may start with
  GUI/web friendly frameworks such as RStudio or Jupyter. Eventually, some of
  these will exceed the capacity of Jupyter/Rstudio, they need to move over to
  HPC batch system. There is a big jump / disconnect between the two
  frameworks.

#### On "hpc-novice" lesson

Repo: https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-novice/

Rationale for the lesson:
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-novice/issues/2#issuecomment-1058169628

#### Reviewing objectives

Work-level issue: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/387
(PRIMARY) Ref: https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/105

Current objectives at the top of the HPC Intro landing page:
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/index.md

> By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:
>
> - Identify problems a cluster can help solve
> - Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to operate a
>   computer, connect to a cluster, and write simple shell scripts.
> - Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler, transfer files, and
>   use software through environment modules.

Note: The latter part of the hpc-intro lesson, the "scaling" part, will be
modified to use Alan's "amdahl" code <https://github.com/ocaisa/amdahl> .

Task (Homework):

- Go through every episode and match the objectives to the overall object
