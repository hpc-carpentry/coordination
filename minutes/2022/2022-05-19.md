# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 19 May 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

- Meet
  [Katherine Cahill,](https://www.oh-tech.org/profiles/katharine_cahill_phd)
  Education and Training specialist at the Ohio Supercomputing Center, and
  discuss areas of obvious mutual interest.
- By now, hopefully the refactoring [PR][refactor-pr] has been merged, and the
  [HPC Intro][intro-lesson] lesson is much improved. Brief discussion of the
  status of the flagship lesson is appropriate here.
  - what needs to be done for hpc-intro to be marked _beta_?
- Should we compose a formal
  [strategic plan](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/111)?
  This might help make our efforts legible to potential outside contributors?
- At previous [coordination meetings][last-coord], we discussed our "product
  suite", with a view to building something compatible with the larger
  Carpentries workshop set-up scheme. Discussion focused on a couple of
  candidate "tracks" that might make sense. Consensus seemd to be that the
  Software user track under discussion was the logical next step, with
  attention on running pre-existing executables. HPC Data or a container lesson
  make sense as the next point of focus.
- The existing container content presents some challenges, in that it includes
  both Docker and Singularity containers, and is SLURM-specific, but it's a
  reaosnable jumping-off point.
- Additional track ideas, so as not to lose them:
  - Developer track: Shell novice, HPC Intro, Python Intro, then HPC Python or
    another development lesson.
  - Basket of resources: HPC performance analysis, GPU programming, Chapel?
- All of this will benefit from a larger workforce. We should probably
  publicize our efforts better.
  - [CarpentryCon](https://2022.carpentrycon.org/) Conference is early
    August 2022.
  - The [UK RSE Conference](https://rsecon2022.society-rse.org/key-dates/).
    Call for submissions closes May 2, 2022.
  - [PEARC](https://pearc.acm.org/). 2022 deadlines have passed, but it's
    annual, so 2023?
  - [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/all-dates-deadlines/). BoF deadline
    is July 1, 2022.
  - Near-future [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events.html)
    events?
    - Best Practices in HPC Training and Education (Tandem with SC?)
    - HPC Education and Training for Emerging Technologies (Tandem with ISC?)
    - Strategies for Enhancing HPC Education and Training (Tandem with PEARC?)
      - Call for proposal:
        https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/SEHET22_CFP.html
- Should we consider nontraditional or non-academic outreach channels? Guest
  appearances on HPC podcats? Write-ups by HPCWire? Find out the secret
  identity of HPC Guru on twitter?
- Another way to get a larger workforce or to get more work done is to think
  about fundraising. What problems do we have that could be solved with money,
  and where might money come from?
- We should re-nominate people for the steering committee. See the
  [HPC Carpentry election guidance](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/36)
  for our process.

## 1100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Dirk Barbi

### Guest: Dirk Barbi

Dirk Barbi, team lead at U. Bonn in Germany, they are planning to do a
curriculum for HPC courses, starting from the very beginning. 2nd group, HPC
and Analytics, does more advanced topics.

Dirk is in a tuning/loop-unrolling role (RSE-like?), sees students waste a lot
of time trying to get up to speed on the resources.

Has a constraint: Wants to use the code from the HPC Cetificaiton Forum, for
various reasons.

Alan: Shell extras has a lot of what is needed, maybe just contribute to that?
Dirk: If this allowed, we can talk about this.

Dirk: Also wants to also cover using vi and emacs? But shell lesson covers
nano. They will also cover Jupyterhub and Visual Studio or whatever, but it's
not basic linux.

(Aside w/Toby about editor skills -- it's about balance and where best to use
the available time in the lesson. Nano has a low barrier to entry, and/but was
chosen for skill-priority reasons.)

Q from Alan: Wants one course with all the non-HPC stuff, and then another one
that has a similar scope to HPC-Intro.

"If I'm allowed": There is some time pressure, wants to clone shell-extras and
build the thing he wants, and then re-visit the relationship with the "parent"
repo.

Toby: Redundancy in the incubator is not forbidden, the scheme is generally to
notify people who propose redundant-seeming lessons about the apparent
redundancy, and then accept their answer either way.

Concern from Dirk: One issue is that Dirk's institution needs to ensure that he
hits his certification targets, so an open, community-driven collaboration
process risks having the community decide to remove some marginal-utility
content that nevertheless is a required target from the skills tree.

Pointed him at the hopefully-soon-to-be-merged branch from the tkphd intro, as
a better way to assess this community's efforts.

### The Big PR

Andrew had a comment about the jargon-buster presentation vs the in-line
jargon. Learners reacted badly to the in-line scheme, and liked the
presentation when we did it.

Trevor: We can/should be biased in favor of making the lesson work
interactively, even if it makes it harder to learn from without an instructor.

Option: Record the presentation as a video, be ready to re-record it if there
are important changes. "Off-line" leaners and not-us instructors can use the
video.

Q about the animated firewall picture. This isn't part of the presentation,
it's for the lesson material. Animation is nice.

Other PR rabbit holes: What's allowed on the head node? CPU limits on the head
node (e.g. in Juelich), etc. Deferred.

### Strategic Plan

Should we have something written down, and if so where should it be? Put it on
the website? Consensus: Yes, we should; it should go on the hpc-carpentry.org
webiste.

### Product Suite

Alan & Trevor: Snakemake is nice, need to re-genericize it? Move the Amdahl's
law material and use the workflow tools to build up the timing data?

### Outreach

CarpentryCon: We did something in 2020, is that material available? Alan: It's
in the repos, migth be hard to find.

Toby says we should definitely do something for CarpentryCon, there are several
categories one can propose. A development sprint would be nice, if we can tee
up a tractable issue set (or the sprint might be to do that?). We could
advertise a trial workshop. Lightning talk, to increase general awareness of
our efforts?

We need to submit an Incubator Spotlight talk for HPC Intro at CarpentryCon'22,
at the very least.

### Steering Committee Elections

Nomination [issue](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/114) is
now open.

## 2100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (He/him), ODU

### Guests

- Kate Cahill: [Ohio Supercomputer Center](https://www.oh-tech.org)
- Aaron Weeden: [Shodor](http://www.shodor.org), A National Resource for
  Computational Science Education
  - Activities/lesson materials: http://www.shodor.org/activities/

### Meeting Notes

#### Current direction of HPC Carpentry

##### Development of lesson plan:

**"HPC User track"**

- HPC-intro (programming language agnostic)

  - basic model of HPC & job scheduler interaction
  - swap out

- Workflow (snakemake)

  - and hpc-python, to also introduce

- Containers
  - candidate lesson: see Carpentries incubator

**"HPC Developer's track"**

- Programming with Fortran
- Programming with MPI

**"Basket of Resources"**

Other relevant contributions:

- GPU programming (recent pull request)
- Performance analysis
- Dask
- Chapel

##### Target audience

Question on target audience:

- Not many today know things about parallelism, performance, etc.

##### Customizability

Using snippets library, to adapt for different HPC environments (queueing
system, filesystem partitions, ...).

##### Infrastructure

Where can we run workshops like this? Maybe virtual cluster built on top of
cloud (AWS, ...)?

#### HPC-intro

- Builds on top of UNIX shell skills
- Key concepts
  - Basic architecture of HPC
  - Why designed that way and why used that way.
  - Connecting to remote system
  - Working with job scheduler (e.g. `sinfo`, `sbatch`, `squeue`)
  - Submitting job
  - Basic parallel processing

Many HPC users want to use specific software packages.

Some comments we received from community:

- "Why not use XSEDE resources? They are awesome."

  XSEDE still requires understanding of how HPC works. Other viable ways are
  now available: Gateways, Open OnDemand.

- Aaron: regarding Shodor Foundation

  The foundation is concerned on computational science education, on middle
  school and high school levels. Coordinating resources with Bluewaters.
  Recent: teaching parallel computing & HPC. Early on, introduce applications
  that have real science use cases. Many people don't realize they need more
  computing power than what desktop can afford. So, need to indicate ahead of
  time what kind of computing power is good to work on HPC and what not good.

- Andrew: What examples? Using certain specific example (e.g. from DFT) tend to
  alienate people from other disciplines.

  Example applications:

  - disease spread
  - forest fire spread
  - predator-prey relationship

  These apps have pattern parallel to what's in real scientific application.
  Try to underline the commonalities on different application areas.

- Andrew: If you have so many examples, how can you build a workshop with so
  many examples?

  Select examples that appeal to most audience. Based on user survey.

##### Specializing "intro to HPC"?

Generic workload is used in HPC Carpentry. People are welcome to customize with
different workloads (e.g. bioinformatics).

Maintaining lesson (w/ templates. etc) is already a nightmare, keeping multiple
"splinters" of the different variants and flavors will be intractable for this
small community of maintainers.

- Q (WP): How to help maintain specialized versions that can continually merge
  in upstream changes?

#### Using HPC Carpentry materials

Best for taught in a live workshop. It is not out of reach that these workshop
materials (e.g. the Carpentry lesson) will be used as a self-study resource.
For some resources, having extra mode of instruction can be helpful, e.g. "HPC
jargon busting". Perhaps having recorded video of somebody explaining that part
of the lesson can be helpful add-on to make the resources more suitable for
self-paced study.

#### Strategic Planning?

Should we formalize the strategic plan? Having understanding of who our
audience (those needing to take this lesson), is going to be helpful.

#### Observed Needs

Having several variants of the same lesson, e.g. Python and R.

How do I use multiple cores to leverage parallelism in Python? In R?

Example from HPC-Carpentry lesson: the "pi" calculator. Started off as a serial
code, then parallelize it (in embarassingly parallel fashion). High-level
concept taught:

- start with serial
- add more CPU cores and see where parallelism helps, and where it stops
  helping
