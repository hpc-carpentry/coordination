# HPCC Coworking Hours: 3 November 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## 12:00 UTC Session

### Participants

- _name & pronouns, affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/UB
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Planning for Discussion with The Carpentries' Executive Committee

At our [last][last-coord] Coordination Meeting, we agreed to meet with The
Carpentries' EC (Kari Jordan & Erin Becker) in the next few weeks.
[**_Details_**](https://codimd.carpentries.org/Psfy9tsiQZyneMlxqiN5Hg#Joining-the-Carpentries-Roadmap)

Refer to the [Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh].

There is also an
[issue](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/119) on the
coordination repo about fleshing out our roadmap.

### COWS Analysis

A COWS ([SWOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis)) analysis will help
us see our own status more clearly.

#### Challenges (Harmful, External): No Time or Energy = Bad Outcomes

- Technical challenge to provide/access appropriate resources for the lessons
- HPC Carpentry lessons require supplementary technical knowledge (vs.
  pedagogical skills) not common in the existing pool of instructors
- Adoption of the lesson program by existing HPC training providers
- No data on demand for HPC Carpentry workshops and/or the skills that they
  teach
- Engagement from non-core community contributors has been sparser than
  expected/desired, interest garnered from events has not been converted into
  activity on the repos.

#### Opportunities (Helpful, External): Time + Energy = Good Outcomes

- HPC is a growing field and becoming more diverse, and Carpentries provides a
  structure to bring new people in, with a low barrier to entry.
- Many organisations are having to provide some level of training in HPC
  (perhaps for the first time)
- Instructors: tap into existing Carpentries pool, "fork" communities using
  variants of HPC Carpentry
- Tools exist to rapidly stand up HPC systems with a standard configuration on
  existing cloud resources. Workshops can be run independently of local
  resources.
- Our content is related to some high-value research skills, such as big data
  and cloud computing -- low barrier to adding value in this space.
- There are a number of lessons in the incubator that are complemented by HPC
  Carpentry (containers, workflows, domain specific,...)
- A large number of Forks exist (in multiple languages): there is lots of
  interest, which we can pull back into the fold
- Outreach efforts have garnered interest in our project.

#### Weaknesses (Harmful, Internal)

- Lack of existing material to support improvement of typical Carpentries
  instructor technical skills
- Poor coordination with fragmented related initiatives (GPU, Chapel)
- More focus on lesson development
- The existing lessons are written for specific clusters, with snippets
  provided by sysadmins/experts. This does not scale well and leads to forks.
- Our lessons are either pre-alpha or alpha: no helpers or instructors from
  outside the HPC Carpentries community yet
- Lack of assessment material from the training events already delivered
- Community-buliding efforts (SC21, CarpentryCon) have generally not been
  successful in enlarging the contributor base.
- The core team has been slow to execute and close on issues.

#### Strengths (Helpful, Internal)

- Well-developed governance structure, culture of regular meetings
- Strategic plan for self-contained workshops, supplementary content
- Strong technical HPC skills within the existing team
- Good lesson content already in place
- Existing HPC Carpentry leadership is very familiar with The Carpentries,
  track record of engagement in the community, and deep experience with the
  lesson infrastructure (albeit the old infrastructure).
- We have the knowledge, skills, and people to stand up HPC cloud resources.
  And an expert in determining scope.
- hpc-intro lesson has been thoroughly alpha tested
- Our lesson program meshes nicely with the existing Carpentries curricula
- The HPC Carpentry community strives to follow the same values as The
  Carpentries - see http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/values/, where we reproduce
  The Carpentries Core Values.
- HPC Carpentry has survived at least one Changing of the Guard (Peter &
  Christina)
- Lessons have been designed to fit the standard Carpentries 2-day workshop
  format

### Other notes

Toby puts us at the end of
[Pre-Incubation](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-1-pre-incubation).

### TODO:

- Read through our Challenges & Weaknesses, and try to come up with Solutions
  (or pathways to solutions).
- Do the same for the Opportunities.
- Identify overlap between things we want/need to do that might already be part
  of the incubation roadmap.
