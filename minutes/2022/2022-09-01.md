# HPCC Coworking Hours: 1 September 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

### Open PRs on hpc-intro

#### [#411: Amdahl's Law](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/411)

[PR#411](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/411) would
incorporate the Amdahl's Law code into HPC Intro. There has been some
discussion in that PR already. Can we work to resolve issues with the
implementation?

- `pip install amdahl` is a reasonable default that will pull in dependencies.
  - Assumes a shared directory across the cluster, which is also a reasonable
    default. For resources that don't do that, workshop organizers will have to
    work around this. Our workshops will already require some degree of
    instructor on-boarding, so the shared-directory expectation can become part
    of that process, along with other items, e.g. how to select a snippet
    sub-set at config-time, and other issues.
- If `amdahl --help` works, it could print an extract of README and link to the
  repository
- Benson points out that `pip` may be unavailable on some firewalled HPC
  resources (can't actually reach PyPI). `pip install` from the tarball would
  then make sense, _provided_ `mpi4py` is locally available.

#### [#418: Birmingham](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/418)

[PR #418](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/418) has been
open for a while, and has seen a number of updates in the last couple of weeks.
Changes were made to `gh-pages`, so it can't be merged at the moment.

### Open PRs on hpc-workflows

#### [#23: Set Cores](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/23)

[PR#23](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/23) has
been open without review for a while.

#### [#24: Zipf -> Amdahl](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/24)

[PR#24](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/24) has
been open without review for a while.

### Other Business

- [name=Toby] has news, the EU funding opportunity that has been discussed
  earlier has been awarded to some folks that Toby knows. HPC Carpentry _per_
  _se_ is not mentioned in the proposal, but it's a training grant, and there
  is a requirement to teach material that follows the HPC Carpentry curriculum.
  The awardee is EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), in collaboration
  with ZB-Med, EPFL, University of Barcelona, Freiburg, Oslo, and some industry
  partners in Germany, Norway, and Spain. A likely result for us is that there
  will be people who are paid to teach the material, so this may help to
  enlarge our community. Their project is described in an EMBL blog post
  [here](https://grp-bio-it.embl-community.io/blog/posts/2022-08-31-bio-nt-funded/).
