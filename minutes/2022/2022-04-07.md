# HPCC Coworking Hours: 7 April 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

### Agenda

#### Action Item Updates

[Last month][last-cowork], we recorded the following Action Items. Status
reports?

> 1. **All:** take notes on the current Objectives and Outcomes of HPC Intro
>    and its episodes.
>    - Are the skills in keeping with our current notion of the scope?
>    - Is the material in keeping with the skills & scope?
>    - Do objectives need to be added or revised?
>    - Does material need to be expanded or removed?
> 1. **Trevor:** add a "suggested workshop sequences" page to the > website
>    - Intro Workshop
>      1. Shell Novice (morning 1)
>      1. HPC Intro (afternoon 1 + morning 2)
>      1. Singularity (afternoon 2)
>    - Advanced Workshops (modular)
>      1. Big Data on HPC (morning 1)
>      1. HPC Programming Intro (afternoon 1)
>      1. MPI Programming (morning 2)
>      1. GPU Programming (afternoon 2)
> 1. **Trevor:** -- Propose migrating hpc-parallel-novice to The Incubator
> 1. **Benson:** -- create a Parallel Programming lesson
>    - _N.B.:_ The Carpentries
>      [**_Curriculum Development Handbook_**](https://cdh.carpentries.org)
>    - Propose renaming _hpc-parallel-novice_ to _hpc-parallel-data_ or
>      _hpc-python-data_
>    - Propose (or do) a new lesson on HPC Programming, using the current
>      _hpc-intro_ as its basis
>      - Clone _hpc-intro_ as the basis of a new _hpc-parallel-programming_
>        lesson, centered around `pi.py`
>        - Objectives: basics of MPI (comm, rank, scatter/gather)
>        - Language of choice will still be Python?
>        - Is _hpc-parallel-python_ an appropriate name, in terms of clarity &
>          scope?
>          - _hpc-python-programming_ vs. _hpc-python-data_ perhaps?
>      - Request @stoltzstrop open a new PR against the new repo based on the
>        [GPU PR][gpu-pr]
>      - update README, refine scope of the new lesson
>      - Revise learning objectives & outcomes: what skills will the lesson
>        teach?

See [PR#389](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/389) for
HPC Intro updates.

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
-

### Notes

#### Notes on HPC-Intro Goals

Trevor and Andrew have worked through episodes 10-15 (including refactoring the
lessons and adding a new file). There are currently nested PRs on this,
[PR#389](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/389) against
the Incubator repo, ~~and a secondary one against the tkphd repo~~.

- Merged! Thanks!

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto, ODU

### Agenda

1. Discuss the earlier meeting's [action items](#Action-Items).
2. Work on [coordination/105: Lesson Objectives & Outcomes
   Review][lesson-objectives].

### Notes

#### Rehash of 2022-03-17

"Container lesson": from end-user perspective (not packaging a new container).
Goal: How to consume container productively.

Note: Currently existing lessons on containers do not quite match what we need:

Consensus from last meeting: For hte "introductory HPC track", we will remove
all the coding sessions. Because that will be overkill for new learners.

The intermediate

Possible topic for upcoming coordination:

- outreach
- community building
-

Current work done so far:

- 10

Possible meetings to reach out re: HPC Carpentry:

- PEARC'22: https://pearc.acm.org/pearc22/
- BPHTE'21 (last year):
  https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/BPHTE21_Technical_Program.html -- in
  tandem with SC conference
- HETET'21 (last year): https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/HETET21.html --
  in tandem with ISC'21 conference
- CarpentryCon

Should we present at CarpentryCON?
