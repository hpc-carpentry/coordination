# HPCC Coworking Hours: 6 October 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## 11:00 UTC Session

### Participants

- _name & pronouns, affiliation_
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Open PRs on hpc-intro

#### [#411: Amdahl's Law](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/411)

- Trevor has to make revisions on this before it's ready for further review.

#### [#421: Birmingham](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/421)

[PR #421](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/421) is ready
for review.

- [name=andrew] Verified that the Birmingham snippets do not break the build.
  Approved for merge. Merged.

### Open PRs on hpc-workflows

#### [#23: Set Cores](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/23)

[PR#23](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/23) has
been open without review for a while.

#### [#24: Zipf -> Amdahl](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/24)

[PR#24](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/24) has
been open without review for a while.

- [name=toby]: this has been merged, no?
- [name=andrew]: Yes, merged Sept. 1 2022.

### Other Business

- Writing a post/posts about HPC Carpentry lesson(s) for the Incubator Lesson
  Spotlight (Toby)
  - you could submit a post for either hpc-intro or hpc-workflows, or both as a
    single post, OR both as separate posts - whatever you decide would work
    best for you
  - more about the series and its purpose at
    https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/spotlight.html
  - submit content via this short web form: https://forms.gle/DH2noeYH5yNSpNLJ6
- Also, the RSE Slack workspace would be a good place to announce/discuss HPC
  Carpentry to drive up interest

- It would be useful to track unique lesson visitors, to get some idea of
  interest/popularity. The Carpentries use [Matomo](https://matomo.org), not
  Google Analytics. May also want a lesson on data management, could modify
  library carpentry web scrapping lesson, or have a cloud lesson within HPC
  Carpentry.

- Brief discussion about
  [PR #422](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/422), which
  has been open for a while with a trivial change pending. Conensus that the
  change can probably just be made directly and this can be merged, since the
  contributor has not responded to comments.

- Password management lesson? Other methods of authentication.

  Iceland

Made direct edits to PR#422 on the hpc-intro repo and merged it.

Much discussion about PR#23 on the hpc-workflows repo. Mostly captured in the
PR notes. There is pedagogical value in starting with the default set-up for
the snakemake tool, requiring the use of the "-c" argument to control the
degree of parallelism, and then later introducing the idea of the profiles, and
the implicit state that they bring, later on.

Versions of snakemake appear to vary in their treatment of "-c" and "-j" -- the
older (pre-5.0?) versions treat them as equivalent, apparently, but in later
versions, "-j" limits the number of cluster jobs that will be submitted, and
seems to be entirely unrelated to "-c". Do we need to standardize on a
particluar (or maybe just minimum) version?
