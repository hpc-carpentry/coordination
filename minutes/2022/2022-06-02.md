# HPCC Coworking Hours: 2 June 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

1. Can we merge the [HPC Intro PR][refactor-hpc-intro]?
2. Has everybody voted in the [2022 Steering Committee Elections][elections22]?
3. Let's draft a submission for CarpentryCon! (due 12 June)

### [CarpentryCon][carpentrycon]

> #CarpentryCon2022 will have six types of sessions:
>
> - [x] **_Breakout discussions_** will be 1.5 hour-long and conducted in a
>       round table or general discussion format. These discussions will play a
>       crucial role in connecting participants based on shared interests and
>       stimulate discussion on relevant topics.
> - [x] **_Lesson and resource development sprints_** will be one-day to
>       two-week-long collaborative efforts to co-develop lessons and resources
>       relevant to the community. Opportunities will be provided to contribute
>       synchronously and asynchronously to these sprints.
> - [x] **_Lightning talks_** will be short, 5-minute presentations to share
>       tips with the community (e.g., techniques to improve research and
>       teaching, growing a local Carpentries community). These will be
>       pre-recorded so that subtitles in multiple languages can be added and
>       to accommodate asynchronous viewing. There will also be a time in the
>       program dedicated to synchronous viewing and Q&A with the presenters.
> - [ ] **_Panel sessions_** will be 1-1.5 hour-long live discussions about a
>       specific topic amongst a selected group of panellists who share
>       differing perspectives. The proposal author or suggested lead will
>       moderate and guide the panel and audience through the event. Panellists
>       are ideally 3-4 experts in the field who will share ideas,
>       evidence/studies, and opinions and address questions from the audience.
> - [ ] **_Skill-up workshops_** will be 1.5-2 hour-long sessions that provide
>       professional development opportunities where community members share
>       their expertise.
> - [ ] **_Social events and informal meetups_** will be 1-2 hour-long sessions
>       that allow attendees to network with other community members. As
>       determined by each session host, these sessions will range from
>       informal discussions to playing games to virtual storytelling. We
>       encourage creativity!

- A **_Breakout Discussion_** might help bring fresh ideas
- A **_Sprint_** could help jump-start momentum on a new or nascent lesson.

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite

Did some co-work on PR 389 ("the big PR"), interactively accepted some changes
and edits.

Benson said he'd work on a draft for the CarpentryCon presentation, work will
take place ~~on a PR on the coordination repo~~ right here.

#### Lesson and Resource Development Sprint Proposal

- _Please provide a short title for your proposal, capturing what your intended
  audience can expect from attending this session._

  High Performance Workflows with Snakemake

- _Please provide 3-5 keywords relevant to your proposed session._

  High Performance Computing, Snakemake, workflow automation

- _Please provide a short abstract of no more than 250 words that includes a
  session overview, intended audience, and expected outcomes._

  After an HPC Carpentry workshop has introduced the scheduler and simple
  parallel execution, a logical follow-up lesson would involve exercising the
  cluster and performing a scaling study on a parallel program, to demonstrate
  the benefit of parallelization. We plan to fork the Workflows in Snakemake
  lesson from the Incubator, using its framework to spin up a number of jobs
  with varying degrees of parallelism that feed into a plotting script. The
  final result will be a Snakemake script encapsulating the workflow and a plot
  showing the limits of parallel scaling, from which further lessons can build
  a deeper understanding of parallel programming frameworks and optimization.

- _Briefly describe why this session would be of interest to The Carpentries
  community._

  The Carpentries Incubator contains excellent lessons under development on a
  wide variety of topics. In this Sprint, we have the opportunity for a
  community development success story, where a lesson program is significantly
  advanced by building upon material from the Incubator to strengthen an
  emerging lesson program. In this particular case, it's actually a
  re-borrowing, in that the Incubator Snakemake lesson has its origins in an
  HPC Carpentry Parallel Python ancestor.

#### Breakout Session Proposal

- _Please provide a short title for your proposal, capturing what your intended
  audience can expect from attending this session._

  Planning HPC Carpentries' Route to Joining The Carpentries

- _Please provide 3-5 keywords relevant to your proposed session._

  lesson program, administration, incubator, resources

- _Please provide a short abstract of no more than 250 words that includes a
  session overview, intended audience, and expected outcomes._

  The HPC Carpentry community has a number of lessons and resources which
  provide learners with a way in to large (bigger than your laptop) computing
  resources, with all the attendant complexity. Our strategic goal is to join
  The Carpentries, to reach a wider pool of potential learners and
  contributors. Because of the nature of HPC resources -- they are not your
  laptop -- setting up a workshop for this material must include access to some
  kind of HPC resource. In some cases, these can be provided by a host
  institution. For a generic workshop, however, a uniform learning environment
  could be configured as a cloud resource using various technical tools. Cloud
  resources may require funding or sponsorship. In this breakout session, we
  plan to discuss the requirements for standing up an HPC Carpentry workshop,
  the challenges this poses to the existing workshop set-up, and converge on a
  philosophy, framework, or solution that can be successfully handed off to The
  Carpentries.

- _Briefly describe why this session would be of interest to The Carpentries
  community._

  Integrating a new lesson program is of obvious interest to the greater
  Carpentries community. HPC Carpentry is a natural extension of the motivating
  ideas behind The Carpentries, which grapples with the increasingly large
  community of novice users who find themselves with HPC resources, ambitious
  computational tasks to complete, and no obvious path to join the two.
  Consistent with The Carpentries' approach, we hope to encourage good software
  development practices, make scientists more productive, make workflows
  portable and reproducible so institutional knowledge does not disappear when
  short-term students or staff rotate out, and provide learners with a toolkit
  they can use to grow on their own afterwards. The major difference from
  existing Carpentries lesson programs is that HPC workflows necessarily run on
  specialized resources, with particular tools (queueing systems, shared file
  systems) which are not generally available to novice users. Workshop planners
  need to provide these resources, and under the Carpentries umbrella, need to
  do so in a way that can scale, so that workshop planners do not themselves
  have to be HPC experts. Building this bridge between the Carpentries workshop
  set-up scheme and the requirements of HPC Carpentry lessons is a critical
  barrier to overcome in bringing HPC Carpentry under The Carpentries umbrella.

#### Lightning Talk Proposal

- _Please provide a short title for your proposal, capturing what your intended
  audience can expect from attending this session._

  **An Introduction to HPC Carpentry**

- _Please provide 3-5 keywords relevant to your proposed session._

  High Performance Computing, Parallel Computing, Big Data, Reproducibility,
  Cloud Computing

- _Please provide a short abstract of no more than 250 words that includes a
  session overview, intended audience, and expected outcomes._

  This session will introduce a proposed curriculum for an HPC Carpentry set of
  lessons. This session would be one of several sessions that will engage the
  community in developing a flexible and holistic approach to introducing
  techniques that are useful for working with large datasets and utilizing
  existing large simulation software.

- _Briefly describe why this session would be of interest to The Carpentries
  community._

  While high performance computing has typically been associated with
  specialized facilities, it has become significantly more accessible on
  commercial clouds and through research networks such as XSEDE in US and PRACE
  in Europe. In addition, many colleges and universities now also provide high
  performance computing services. Many people who take Carpentries workshops
  that include shell scripting and programming skills can take advantage of
  such computer facilities to reduce processing times for some workloads by
  factors of between 20 and 1000. Such speedups in processing have greatly
  benefitted areas such as computational drug discovery and training of machine
  learning models. This session will briefly introduce these lessons and plans
  for their further development.

### CarpentryCon

We have a lot of questions about The Glorious Future: resources, how to stand
up a workshop, how deploying a cloud-cluster might work, implementing a
very-reproducible environment (_i.e._, pinned versions).

- Sign up for a workshop, get a cluster on AWS _etc._ for 2 weeks starting a
  day or two prior to the start date
- Charged to The Carpentries or directly to the requester? ... since "we know
  exactly how much it'll cost"
- This model Works well for single-node tasks (`amdahl`, `pi.py`)

For lesson tracks under development -- MPI -- multi-node or GPU tasks may
arise.

- Manage MPI library (OpenMPI vs MPICH)
- Consider cost of instances with IB, contiguous or close-by on the switch
