# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 18 August 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### Follow-up from CarpentryCon!

We had several very productive sessions, and now we have things to think and
talk about.

- Feedback from the Social:

  - Kari Jordan said she
    [learned a lot!](https://twitter.com/DrKariLJordan/status/1555253230535319564)
  - Vini Salazar said he
    [liked participating!](https://twitter.com/vinisalazar_/status/1558158513171472386)
  - Several people followed us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hpccarpentry)!

- There are [notes][ccon-breakout] from the break-out sesssion about HPC
  Caprentry's path to the Carpentries, with tons of useful feedback and
  numerous points of entry.

- There are also [notes][ccon-sprints] from the Sprints on the [workflow
  lesson][workflow-lesson], along with issues on the lesson itself.

- We should write a blog post for the Carpentries.

### Communication Channels

This is the first Coordination meeting that we announced on Twitter, and _not_
as an issue on the coordination repository. Any objections?

## 1100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Toby Hodges
- Annajiat Alim Rasel

### Notes

#### Path to Carpentries

Our goal is to create a more detailed roadmap of the steps we are planning to
take, and start talking with Carpentries Curriculum folks about soft spots.

We also need to start working more actively on the
learner-helper-instructor-maintainer pipeline, otherwise this project will not
be self-sustaining. This ties in to a stellar comment from John Chodacki (LC):
effort _increases_ when we join The Carpentries, it doesn't decrease. Annajiat
notes that the work on The Carpentries' side is two-tiered: _x_ for strategic
concerns, _y_ for day-to-day. Toby agrees that the initial effort increases a
lot, but with a healthy community, there will be an off-ramp if/when people
burn out.

WRT resources, cloud resources are to some extent a solved problem within the
Carpentries world, the genomics workshops already use AWS instances, at higher
cost (we think) than we would require. Operating a workshop on a local cluster
with snippets and so forth might actually be a bigger headache.

There's effort overlap, also -- getting the workflow lesson to alpha status
gets us to the point where we have a workshop to offer, which gives us
something to publicize, which we can use to build up the community.

Developing community and demonstrating sustainability: Toby suggests starting
out with 1. scheduling a meeting with Kari & Erin (the Executive Team of The
Carpentries Core Team), and 2. getting hpc-workflows ready for testing in a
workshop. With a complete two-day curriculum, The Carpentries team could
explore providing cloud resources for some pilot workshops, and you could put a
call out to the existing Carpentries community to get involved by running
workshops, providing feedback, contributing improvements, even becoming
Maintainers. If you see a strong response from the existing community, then
that is a great sign. If you do not, then you will probably need to put
significant effort into reaching out to external communities and inviting them
to join in the fun.

#### HPC Workflow Sprints

Good positive feedback, noted above.

Lots of work done off-line on building up a working Snakefile that runs on a
cluster, to identify at the technical level what our actual target is.

There was a breakout activity on reviewing the lesson goals.

One shift in outlook was more serious consideration of requiring some kind of
Python intro as a pre-requisite.

Question from Toby: Do we actually need Python, specifically, or do we need a
conceptual understanding of programming?

- Trevor: R or Python are probably ok: plotting script is written in Python but
  uses concepts that are perhaps more immediately familiar to R users (data
  frames). Could develop an R equivalent but that will increase the maintenance
  load... bad idea.
- We're not going to make people write Python or R, only be able to understand

Some discussion about the motivation for these: The technical motivation is
that there is this list of "widths" that we want to run the amdahl example
over, and this induces a requirement to convert the strings available in the
"wildcard" object to integers for consumption by the cluster configuration.
There must be a Python function that does this, and it's unlike the imperative
shell examples, in that it doesn't run at the "obvious" time, but rather is run
as part of the snakemake run-time activity of building and executing the DAG.

Annajiat: Would a superstore analogy help that we don't shop sequentially how
things are arranged on shelves, rather in the order we need the items?

The question is about how to manage the resulting cognitive load for learners.
If learners have some coding experience, they will be less surprised by the
non-immediate execution, and will also have seen code encapsulation in
functions for deferred execution already. This is not python-specific, it's
conceptual, so it doesn't necessarily induce a Python requirement, but it's a
nontrivial requirement.

Snakefile actions can also be pure Python, which might be an important factor.

Having a pre-req like this complicates workshop organization. Possibly some
coding experience (R or Python, or other nontrivial coding lesson) could be a
recommendation, not a hard requirement?

- It's still acceptable & encouraged to teach a workshop with UNIX Shell & HPC
  Intro, without further prerequisites.
- Learners will not be writing Python programs, but there are some Python
  function calls in the Snakefile.
- The plotting script is Python with Pandas: learners who wish to understand it
  will benefit from having the full Gapminder experience.
- Learners familiar with R should be able to understand everything the Python
  function calls & plotting script are doing.
- Having Python as a prereq frees us up to discuss some concepts, like the fact
  that Python is natively understood by Snakemake. If a learner has more
  advanced needs that the strange constraints of Snakemake don't accommodate,
  but they have a method in Python, they can go ahead and use it.

Feedback from learners will also tell part of this tale.

Interesting read: HPC with R teaches Make, Parallel, and Snakemake in their
Workflows episode. (Massive cognitive load in a brief session, but an
interesting pathway through the material.)

### Action Items

1. Follow-up convo with the Executive Team, soon: next two to four weeks
   - Maybe schedule it once the recordings are released, so Erin, Kari, and
     interested parties can review the breakout discussion?
   - Andrew wants to have a draft roadmap in place before engaging
   - We have momentum & excitement on both sides of (HPC & The) Carpentries,
     which would be sad to lose

## 2100 UTC Session

### Attendees:

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto, ODU

### Notes

#### On building a complete "HPC Carpentry" lesson program

We could make "HPC-intro" + "HPC-workflows" as a complete 2-day workshop on its
own. In this case, the requirement for UNIX shell (and potentially Python as a
strongly suggested component) will be taken care of by requiring participants
to have taken a full 2-day Software Carpentry workshop (either Shell+Python+git
or Shell+R+Git).

For clarity, let's make Python a requirement for _introductory_ "HPC Carpentry"
workshops (e.g. hpc-intro and hpc-workflows). It's ok if people did not have
Python programming background and yet join these basic workshops. But
upper-level workshops (_intermediate_, _advanced_) may (will) require Python as
a hard prerequisite.

#### On Python's presence in the hpc-workflows lesson

At this point in time, the appearance of Python expression in learner's eyes
are not that much:

- visible a little bit in the Snakefile
- hidden in "Amdahl" graybox
- hidden in plotting script graybox

#### On joining the Carpentries

In anticipation of larger workload, it would be good to have more active
community members. But which one is first? Joining the Carpentries or having
larger community? But it does not hurt to start conversation with the
Carpentries team while enthusiasm is still high.

#### PR Works

There's also this PR, on the Amdahl repo:
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/amdahl/pull/10

#### Ongoing tasks

- Amdahl's PR approval

- Review the goals of HPC workflows

  - Ref: see the Sprint CodiMD:
    https://codimd.carpentries.org/hXwa7RTnRSirzvzwTDfeJw#Room-1---locating-Snakemakeworkflow-concepts-in-existing-lesson-content

- "Order of operation" question

- Question on whether / when rules are executed (the statefulness of rules)
