# HPCC Coworking Hours: 6 January 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

#### Work on Issues

- There are a number of actionable issues from the SC'21 BoF, collected in a
  [Milestone](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/milestone/1). Let's
  work on resolving as many as we can.
  - [name=Trevor] is working to merge hpc-shell into hpc-intro
    ([coordination#82](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/82))
- High level: `hpc-intro` is long enough as-is; we can refine its scope, with
  the following lesson sequence:
  - Focus on introductory material & jargon-busting
  - Exercise the scheduler, not a programming language: black-box programs
  - Launch a serial `pi.py` black-box through the scheduler early on
  - Talk through "when we typed _x_, what did the machine do? Why??"
  - Discuss parallel / MPI
  - Launch a parallel `pi.py` black-box program, compare runtime / performance
    / accuracy
- Migrate actual programming work to `hpc-python` (or `hpc-julia`, or `hpc-c`,
  or `hpc-fortran`, or ...)
- [name=Andrew] added some hopefully-clarifying comments to issues
  [95](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/95) and
  [97](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/97), which are
  about making lessons mix/match, and workshop duration, respectively. (97 was
  mis-titled when created, used to say "lesson duration", but multiple lessons
  with different speeds is not something we want to do, and on re-examination
  is not what the BoF question was about.)

### Profiling Tools

Sections/lessons on application profiling with

- [TAU](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php)
- [Extrae](https://tools.bsc.es/extrae)
- [Scalasca](http://www.scalasca.org/)
- [HPCtoolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org/)

Profiling is a valuable tool for showing the performance benefit of HPC systems
and parallelism, these are good tools to be aware of. From the viewpoint of a
lesson, there is potential friction in setting these up. Some languages
(Python, Julia) have a profiling capability already, which has less set-up but
is also less powerful. An additional wrinkle is that some of the tools assume
the interesting part of your executable is the binary code -- for compiled
executables this makes sense, but for Python or Julia, there's a danger of
ending up profiling the interpreter moreso than your executable.

### GPU Kernels

Perhaps make lesson materials out of
[HiPerC](https://github.com/usnistgov/hiperc)?
