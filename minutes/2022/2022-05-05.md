# HPCC Coworking Hours: 5 May 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [21:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join! This meeting is being recorded.][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

### Agenda

#### MagicCastle Tutorial

[<i class="fa fa-user"></i> Alan O'Cais](https://github.com/ocaisa) will
present an intro to ComputeCanada's
[Magic Castle](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle). To code along
(or replicate Alan's environment afterwards), you will need an account and some
experience with [<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> AWS][aws],
[<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Azure][azr], [<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Google
Cloud][gcp], [<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> OpenStack Cloud][osc], or
[<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> OVH][ovh]. If that's in place, refer to the
[setup instructions](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle#setup) to
get started.

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Alan O'Cais
- Andrew Reid
- Trevor Keller
- Benson Muite

### Recording

"Magic Castle: Terraforming the Cloud for HPC"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGpT-C4yy2I&ab_channel=hpc-carpentry Tutorial
by Alan O'Cais.

### Notes

- CLI through Terraform, nothing custom
  - `.tf` is the Terraform file extension
- Puppet config mgmt; reuse ComputeCanada modules
- SELinux node security
- Separate release tarballs for each of 5 common cloud providers

#### Setup

- HTTPS (JupyterHub), SSH, and Globus (GridFTP) services are exposed to the
  outside
  - For best integration with extra services (JupyterHub), it's best to provide
    a domain you control, so you don't have to manage IP addresses, zone files,
    etc.
  - The Cloudflare API must be compatible with your domain; it can't be a
    subdomain.
- `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch` filesystems
- Config includes an SSH public key for the admin user
- 3 instance types: mgmt, login, node
  - AWS: use spot-priced images for nodes, can be much cheaper
- Terraform Cloud lets you manage your cloud conveniently
- Support for RHEL-based distros: [CentOS][centos], [Alma][alma],
  [Rocky][rocky]
- ComputeCanada CERN VFS overlay provides lots of packages
- Users can self-register; admin approves (or not) in web mgmt tool
  - Then use Mokey to manage SSH keys, etc.
- `jupyter-lmod` and `pvserver` for notebooks, dataviz
- Magic Castle is widely used by Compute Canada, so the toolchain is actively
  maintained and relatively mature.
  - OFED (fast interconnects) are coming
  - NFS may be replaced with Lustre
  - Auto-scaling compute _can_ happen, but at the moment it breaks the security
    model and has not been implemented yet
  - External identity providers also in the works

<!-- supported distros -->

[alma]: https://almalinux.org

#### MC-Hub

> _"when Terraform is too difficult_"

- A web-based tool to do Terraform for you
- Provides helpful selection drop-downs for distro, # cores, instance types.
  - This can help new users bootstrap an understanding of Terraform config
    files... or just let the web tool handle it for us
- Caveat: _MC-Hub only works for OpenStack environments!_
- You can impose a cluster lifetime through MC-Hub, so even if you forget, you
  won't get random bills from your cloud provider a month or six down the road

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid, NIST

### Agenda

1. Discuss & merge [hpc-intro/389][refactor-hpc-intro].

### Notes

#### CarpentryCon

> We welcome topics that align with the theme such as:
>
> - [ ] Diversity in coding
> - [ ] Women in artificial intelligence
> - [ ] State of the open source movement
> - [ ] Data care skills for equity
> - [ ] Outreach and awareness of Carpentries outside our community
> - [ ] Data and information literacy in the age of misinformation
> - [ ] Communities and FAIR
> - [ ] Data inclusivity and diversity
> - [ ] Accessible data for all

Maybe _Carpentries and FAIR_ is the best match? (We don't have to choose, but
aligning to one or more invited themes may improve our chances.)

> #CarpentryCon2022 will have six types of sessions:
>
> - [ ] **_Breakout discussions_** will be 1.5 hour-long and conducted in a
>       round table or general discussion format. These discussions will play a
>       crucial role in connecting participants based on shared interests and
>       stimulate discussion on relevant topics.
> - [ ] **_Lesson and resource development sprints_** will be one-day to
>       two-week-long collaborative efforts to co-develop lessons and resources
>       relevant to the community. Opportunities will be provided to contribute
>       synchronously and asynchronously to these sprints.
> - [ ] **_Lightning talks_** will be short, 5-minute presentations to share
>       tips with the community (e.g., techniques to improve research and
>       teaching, growing a local Carpentries community). These will be
>       pre-recorded so that subtitles in multiple languages can be added and
>       to accommodate asynchronous viewing. There will also be a time in the
>       program dedicated to synchronous viewing and Q&A with the presenters.
> - [ ] **_Panel sessions_** will be 1-1.5 hour-long live discussions about a
>       specific topic amongst a selected group of panellists who share
>       differing perspectives. The proposal author or suggested lead will
>       moderate and guide the panel and audience through the event. Panellists
>       are ideally 3-4 experts in the field who will share ideas,
>       evidence/studies, and opinions and address questions from the audience.
> - [ ] **_Skill-up workshops_** will be 1.5-2 hour-long sessions that provide
>       professional development opportunities where community members share
>       their expertise.
> - [ ] **_Social events and informal meetups_** will be 1-2 hour-long sessions
>       that allow attendees to network with other community members. As
>       determined by each session host, these sessions will range from
>       informal discussions to playing games to virtual storytelling. We
>       encourage creativity!

A **_Breakout Discussion_** might help bring fresh ideas, and a **_Sprint_**
could help jump-start momentum on a new or nascent lesson.

#### Big PR

Some folks have announced intentions to review the HPC Intro PR.

#### Snakemake

We looked through the [workflows-snakemake]() Incubator lesson, which does
indeed touch on cluster jobs toward the end. This looks like a good starting
point for an HPC Snakemake lesson -- even if we keep the existing Zipf's Law /
Project Gutenberg corpus example, learners will get something out of it.
