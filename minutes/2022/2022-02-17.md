# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 17 Febuary 2022

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

#### Previous Meetings for Reference

- [Previous Coordination Meeting][last-coord]
- [Previous Coworking Hour][last-cowork]
- [SC'21 BoF Notes][bof-codi]
  - Milestones (issue lists), both [Near-term][sc21-milestone] and
    [Long][sc21-milestone-long]
- [Archive of old Minutes][minutes]

## Agenda:

### BoF Feedback & Issues

Much of the actionable feedback from the SC21 process has been collected into a
[Near-Term Milestone][sc21-milestone] on the coordination repository, along
with a [Long-Term Milestone][sc21-milestone-long] for more-onvolved features.

A discussion of the relative priority and ease of use of the issues in the
milestone is invited.

### HPC Intro Edits

At this point, HPC Shell has been shoehorned into HPC Intro. Setting the HPC
Shell repository to a deprecated or archived state seems appropriate. What are
the next steps for HPC Intro?

### (if time) RSE Workshop: Future Opportunities for Software in Research

https://workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/54/ (Hybrid) workshop hosted by German
RSE network, mid May 2022. HPC Carpentry and lessons learned would be a good
fit, I think, and it may prove a good place to find new
collaborators/contributors for the project?

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST, actually here on time :smile_cat:
- Toby Hodges (he/him)
- Alan O'Cais (he,him)
- Benson Muite

### Notes

Alan's [Amdahl](https://github.com/ocaisa/amdahl) code is pip-installable!

- GitHub action to push to PyPI on release
- Desirable to discuss random numbers in HPC Intro; therefore, upgrade Amdahl
  to jitter timings or somehow create output and show that with naive seeds,
  the results are identical (not useful).
- Likely of value to transfer Amdahl into HPC Carpentry.
- Trevor will prepare a proposal to replace the pi estmation with Amdahl.

#### Pi

The pi calculation material will be moved into parallel novice. There is a
negative review at http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/PractRand.txt of
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software -
Would be good to discuss inclusion of this kind of material in the lessons.

- [name=Benson]: The pi code ties a lot of concepts together (profiling, random
  numbers, motivating low-level optimizations)
- There's also a `python-parallel` lesson under development
- [name=Wirawan]: (Offline question) Can this be elaborated ==>
  https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/103

#### Intermediate concepts

Toby suggests that, while HPC Carpentry could be a collection of lessons
hitting various levels of expertise, it's worth considering the experience of
learners who attend a workshop: if the HPC Intro material is brand new to the
learner, then having a lesson the next day on more intermediate concepts (e.g.,
program optimization) is expecting too much.

Benson: would you be interested to include some of the Incubator lessons being
developed on GPU programming? Trevor: probably in the intermediate lessons
Toby: what are the lessons that belong in a workshop with hpc-intro? Trevor:
parallel novice, some introductory content on applications, e.g. TensorFlow for
GPUs could work, but anything about programming for GPUs is out of scope. Some
material on containerised computing, some lesson on programming for HPC, e.g.
parallel python or Julia. Benson: curriculum could be shell-novice, hpc-intro,
singularity/SPACK/Snakemake or other workflows Trevor: something about
TensorFlow would be good to meet people where they are coming in. Benson: some
cloud content could also fit, for those without access to a cluster.

The Incubator _Docker_ lesson is almost finished; _Singularity_, close but not
yet. These materials would not exactly slot into an HPC Carpentry workshop, so
some adaptation would be needed. Outreach might involve suggesting that we'd
like to make some HPC-related changes, and invite them to get involved with
making it happen.

- [name=Trevor] will setup an example workshop on the HPC Workshops
  organization to show a potential flow of lessons using some of our lessons
  and some Incubator materials that sort-of hang together. (shell, hpc-novice,
  ...)

#### Peer-reviewed lessons

Carpentries Lab
[announced peer review](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/02/carpentries-lab-lesson-review-pilot/)
for lesson materials, in association with [JOSE](https://jose.theoj.org/).

## Later Meeting (Americas)

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Annajiat Alim Rasel

### Notes

- Contributions: we should maintain AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS files, CITATIONS
- On the website's Lessons page, restructure to be less confusing, and list
  some of the extra lessons mentioned at the BoF.
  - Move "our" lessons up top, followed by commentary asking for help.
  - Solicit help from people interested in developing related materials.

Where are we in terms of graduating hpc-intro from the Incubator?

- Re-partition and improve timing info for episodes
- Build a a snippet library for cloud resources
- Have people unaffiliated with HPC Carpentry teach our workshop, possibly
  using a cloud resource we configure on their behalf (or for public use)

Annajiat has historically condensed Git and Shell lessons from 4+ hours down to
2 (each), giving more time in a 2-day workshop for Python. The other lessons
become more like overviews; some material from Shell can be taught in more
depth when it comes up in other places.

Since Python and R eschew the command line, it's hard to make a strong case for
using Git in those lessons without creating confusion & friction.

Where possible, show people how to map these lesson materials into their own
workflows. Example has to do with a genomics lesson, which is mostly done in
the cloud. Having a summary of tools & workflows out there (and lessons
teaching them) to show both what else is possible, and how (or who) to
approach, can accelerate learners' research. The Git lesson's discussion of
open science & data repositories goes along this vein. We might give some
examples of where Linux is crucial in the world... natural language processing,
...

Consider a short episode in HPC intro for HPC applications? Similar/related to
jargon buster. Those fields may help guide future lesson development.
