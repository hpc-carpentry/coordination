# HPCC Meeting, May 16, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

The [CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/)
and [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstracts have been
submitted.

We plan to submit the RSECon24 abstract to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/)
also, the deadline for talk submissions is June 3. This meeting would be a good
time to decide who wants to be an author.

#### Outreach

The [eSciences](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) conversation is now finally
scheduled for May 15, it will have taken place by the time of this meeting, and
we'll have some idea what the areas of overlap are.

The [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/) talk is also coming
together, Andrew is planning to meet with Juan Herrera to finalize the outline
on May 21. The actual talk will likely take place in the second week of June.

### The Website

Our main [website](https://hpc-carpentry.org) has gotten a bit stale over the
past while. This agenda item is motivated in part by some work that Alan O'Cais
already did getting the workshop list updated, but also it has come up at
various times in recent meetings.

The proposed task is to check in on progress on issues identified earlier, and
possibly identify new ones.

We asked Adam Tuft from Durham U. to have a look with fresh eyes at the [last
meeting][last-meeting], possibly something will have come of that.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught once! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

Next up is additional edits, and adapting it for the LLNL and NIST workshops
(see below).

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. There are plans to do a workshop at
LLNL the week of June 3, and probably a NIST workshop a week or two later.

Still not done, these workshops have not been submitted to the workshop form on
the website.

### New Business

Alan put a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of
the HPC Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for
the snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is
a bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Marc-André Hermanns, RWTH Aachen University, he/him
- Alan O'Cais, Univ. of Barcelona he/him
- Adam Tuft, Durham University, UK, he/him
- Andrew Reid, NIST
- Clark Gaylord, George Washington University
- Oscar Masinyana, The Carpentries
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jannetta Steyn, Newcastle University

### Conferences

Weronika redirected Andrew to the right person for SIGHPCeducation.

Sofa Talk at ISC (skill tree): happened! Marc-André will keep in touch with
Jane. The idea of the skill trees is to compare existing materials or
curriculum plans to the skill tree to check the depth of the lessons against
the intended audience, or to classify the material at a given level. This is
likely to be iterative, and the skill trees are in flux.

CarpentryConnect: submitted, should receive a decision in the next few days.

US-RSE in September: we'll likely recycle our RSECon abstract.

Clark will be at PEARC, is willing to look at lightning-talk materials and do
something, if it makes sense. Andrew will provide a pointer to the material
and/or the material itself, we did this at SCAsia24, so it exists.

### Outreach with Netherlands e-Science

Andrew, Alan, Trevor, and Sven met to discuss alignment of their materials with
our audience. The material is dense, but teachable in the allotted time;
hybridizes Carpentries and CodeRefinery materials ad philosophies.

Their parallel Python lesson is intended to run on the learner's laptop; the
GPU lesson is on a remote, GPU-equipped cloud resource. By design, however, the
eScience Center focuses on code development and software skills. HPC aspects
are a partner institution's bailiwick, meaning there is scant opportunity to
collaborate on lesson development.

### Website

- It's unclear from the website what our core lessons actually _are_. Reworking
  as a table to clearly delineate core from extras would be great.
- Listing core maintainers would be good.
- About Us & Governance is a wall of text. Seeing a gallery of current Steering
  Committee members would be preferable.
- Numerous stale Issues that should be triaged.

Question about whether we want to match what the Software Carpentry website.
Toby thinks that probably the HPCC site initially matched the older SWC site,
and that SWC has moved. Probably it will move again, development is on-going on
those resources, so matching the current one is maybe not high-value.

We have a 3-week gap before the next scheduled meeting. Let's schedule a
co-working session to focus on open issues and patching up the website! This
will be planned through Slack.

### Workshops

- (not on the website) Livermore: first week of June, using Maestro instead of
  Snakemake to meet the LLNL community where they are.
- (not on the website) NIST: third week of June

### Archer

The Archer folks ported HPC Intro to the Workbench, including a solution to the
snippets library. It works, but it's ugly. Appears to be easier to maintain.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), ODU

### Other business

Mostly informal sidebars about GPU systems and how to buy them.

### EPCC's Workbench port of HPC Carpentry

Maybe this one? https://epcced.github.io/2024-02-23-hpc-intro-brunel/
([source](https://github.com/EPCCed/2024-06-20-hpc-intro-shampton))

Other Workbench port can be found also:

- https://epcced.github.io/2024-02-22-hpc-shell-brunel/ (HPC-shell)
- https://epcced.github.io/2024-02-23-hpc-intro-brunel/ (HPC-intro)

TODO: Reach out to the people who made the Workbench port to understand what
they are doing, etc.

Investigated
