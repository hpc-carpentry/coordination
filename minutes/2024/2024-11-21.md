# HPCC Meeting, November 21, 2024

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa,
  Asia, and Europe
  - Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], better for the
  Americas and Oceania
  - Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

In keeping with [last time's discussion][last-meeting], we will open with the
broadest scope.

As a reminder, the
[full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of
[several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on
the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress
arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops,
and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture.

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which
are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The
goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable
pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there
is to do.

### Carpentries Incubation

Project page on HPCC Github:
https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/1

From the
[Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation),
**the Lesson Project will complete the following tasks:**

#### 1. Policies and Processes ([_discussion_](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/132))

_to ensure compliance with existing Carpentries policies and processes_

- [x] Agree to abide by The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC)
- [x] Agree to have at least one trained instructor for each workshop
- [x] Agree to The Carpentries workshop fee structure
- [x] Define at least one curriculum that fits The Carpentries two-day workshop
      structure
- [x] Agree for the Lesson Project to be included in Organizational Membership
      agreements

##### Policies Follow-up

- [ ] Formalize our commitments in the Charter and on our website.

#### 2. Governance ([_discussion_](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/133))

_to ensure consistency with existing lesson program governance, and
accountability for leading the work during Incubation_

- [ ] Establish a culturally and linguistically diverse Lesson Program
      Committee (LPC) of at least three people to serve as a governance body
      and point of contact with The Carpentries.
- [ ] The LPC should create a document describing this group’s roles and
      responsibilities.
- [x] The LPC should meet at least quarterly to oversee Lesson Project
      activities.
- [x] The LPC must demonstrate experience having discussions and making
      decisions by providing The Carpentries Core Team and Board of Directors
      with access to meeting minutes.

##### Governance Follow-up

- [ ] [Elections! and Charter, not in that order](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/144)

#### 3. Contributions

_to ensure a community of sufficient size and health exists to support the new
Lesson Program after adoption_

- [ ] Assign at least three maintainers to maintain each of the lessons,
      without unreasonable overlap between the maintainer teams of each lesson
      (i.e. the same people maintaining multiple lessons)
- [ ] Create an onboarding document and process for existing Carpentries
      instructors so that they can determine whether or not they should
      consider teaching these lessons
- [ ] Create a plan to recruit additional instructors for the program
- [ ] Create a plan to recruit new contributors to the program’s lessons
- [ ] Demonstrate community support for the lessons (for example by providing
      metrics on GitHub activity, attendance at collaboration sessions,
      feedback from instructors, or similar metrics)

##### Contributions Follow-up

#### 4. Teaching

_to ensure quality of curriculum, and demand for workshops_

- [ ] Run pilot workshops to gather feedback on the curriculum and confirm that
      it is ready for teaching by the Instructor community
- [ ] Collect and analyze post-workshop feedback
- [ ] Complete and refine core curriculum, incorporating relevant workshop
      feedback
- [ ] Assign one or two leads for workshop coordination and communications work
- [ ] A list of workshops run during the Incubation Phase, or in the past year
      (whichever is the longer period of time)
- [ ] A list of organizations which have expressed interest in hosting
      centrally organized workshops using the Lesson Project’s curriculum
- [ ] A list of people who are able to teach the Lesson Project’s
      curriculum/curricula, whether or not they are already certified
      Carpentries Instructors
- [ ] Provide details of any special requirements for the Lesson Project’s
      workshops, for example resources or infrastructure that The Carpentries
      would need to provide for workshops to succeed.

#### 5. Supplementary Materials

- [ ] Letters of interest from organizations wanting to host workshops. These
      letters of interest might indicate that the organisation
- [ ] Summary of where funding support has been sought for this work, whether
      or not applications were successful
- [ ] Summary of how personal time has been dedicated to this project (i.e. how
      much has been volunteer hours and how much has been supported through
      employers) - if supported by employers, what is the outlook for that
      support continuing?
- [ ] Summary of any infrastructure needs for supporting the Lesson Project’s
      workshops, along with a list of community members who are able to help
      fulfill any special requirements described in 4.8 above, and/or a plan
      for onboarding other community members to support it

#### On teaching

Marc-Andre plans to offer HPC Carpentry workshops once a month for 12 months.

- Run on various platforms: HPCC MagicCastle cluster; other clusters; (also
  proposed: use Jannetta's MiniHPC)

This should cover for "pilot teaching" & "workshops run during the Incubation
Phase" for now.

Regarding the use of Carpentries infrastructure: Right now perhaps not the time
to do it because of complications coming from data protection clause of the
Carpentries infrastructure. Thus we still need to rely on our own
infrastructure (e.g. Google Form).

We need to do better at gathering feedback: we need to push to do the
post-workshop activities (e.g. feedback, analysis, lessons learned). Toby: here
is an example of how you can
[build a form as an issue template](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/lesson_proposal.yml)

#### On governance

The [current governance page](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/)
contains only one committee. Our prior consideration was to create two
committees (one to deal with visionary/directional issues and the other for
curriculum [lesson development]). But since we are a very small team right now
(where everyone is doing everything), eventually we felt to keep only one
committee for the time being.

We can consider lessons taken from other Carpentries program:

- Data Carpentry has multiple committees since the lesson programs are so
  diverse, no one has knowledge about everything.

- Software Carpentry only has one governance committee since the lessons are
  pretty uniform.

- Library Carpentry initially wanted to create multiple committees, but after
  running for a while, it became apparent that it is better to coalesce
  everyone into one group only.

(ref: SWC Governance: https://github.com/swcarpentry/governance)

- [ ] TODO: Create a charter for governance: i.e. document our governance

  - [ ] Target the language toward the uninitiated audience (i.e. those who do
        not know what "the Carpentries" is all about)
  - [ ] Make a "roles and responsibilities" section on the Governance.
  - [ ] Potentially create a "roadmap" of the ultimate governance structure
        looks like. (pending new website update)

Notes:

- Website needs to be switched to a new format.
  - Now that HPC Carpentry is in formal incubation into the Carpentries, we
    will want to begin using HPCC website to take on the new template.

### On Election

We need to do our own election of the steering committee members! It was
supposed to take place in June.

Input: A bit more diversity will be good (countries of origin, ethnicity,
gender). There has also been interest in the HPCC meetings for a while;
including them can make them feel more included.

### On a Recent Workshop

(Shared by Jannetta)

A recent HPC Carpentry workshop was run on Monday (Newcastle University:
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 18-19 Nov 2024, EPCC (Instructor: Evgenij Belikov (EPCC),
Helpers: Jannetta Steyn (NCL), Mike Taverne (Northumbria))). Some variations
observed:

- It was using `hpc-shell` lesson
- It was using `awk '{ print}` instead of `cut` command

Input: It will be good to gain feedback from these instructors. Learn the
reasonings behind the changes they made. Help inform them the present
"standard" structure/contents of HPC Carpentry workshop (without requiring them
to do only those contents).

Suggestion: It will be useful to have a bank of exercises for instructors to
use during the workshops, if so desired by them.

We also will want to run more workshops (not only in Americas, but also other
parts of the world).

### History of LLNL summer workshop

How did that come about? LLNL is a huge lab with many big computers. They are
also very lab-mission oriented.

Jane Herriman was tasked to "broaden the adoption" of HPC utilization (beyond
those who do weapons research, etc.). She found the existing materials were not
aligned well enough to what she wanted, so she reached out to HPCC. The rest
was history.

CSC Finland: their training materials need to be updated. They were considering
if they could leverage HPCC's hpc-intro. This is also an opportunity. CSC is
part of EuroHPC. We need to grow the number of European instructors so they can
also teach HPCC in many European institutions.

### Engagements with large HPC sites

That some large centers began turning to HPCC was a very interesting
phenomenon. We may want keep in mind of large HPC centers: Generally, they have
their own established training materials & program. But they may not want to do
"basic train" part (? @Alan please fix this). This represents an opportunity
for HPCC to step in.

LLNL is a huge site, and we were asked to come in and do an introductory
training. This is a departure from expectation, which was that universities
would provide this type of training. Toby, Alan, and Andrew (at least) wish to
revisit this conversation.

#### On a scaled-up workshop at NERSC

NERSC requested a remote workshop for 200+ attendees: this breaks the model in
several ways.

There was a thought (posed to Andrew after the BPHTE presentation) of
conducting an hpc-intro workshop for NERSC next year in the summer (similar to
LLNL 2024 summer workshop). But the scale was starkly different: an instruction
for 200 simultaneous leaners. Challenges:

- Is it possible to do this without breaking the Carpentries model? I.e. to
  ensure everyone follows through and gets the help they need, instead of
  becoming disengaged due to getting lost.
- Will there be enough helpers to assist learners (in-person/virtually)?

If we want to make the NERSC workshop happen, we will need to address these
issues.

Some centers have done scalable training in a hybrid mode: An instructor
teaching centrally from a remote site; learners gather in multiple sites; each
site must have 1 or more helpers (and perhaps also one leader); they receive
the bulk instruction from the central instructor, but then receive help locally
& in-person.

Examples:

- PSC monthly HPC workshops (formerly was sponsored by XSEDE, but now ACCESS)
- CodeRefinery workshops

### Post-SC Workshop Engagement/Reflection

- NERSC may be interested to request a hpc-intro workshop for next Summer
  (2025) -- see above
- Someone from Rwanda talked briefly with Andrew after the BPHTE presentation.
  There might be interest in them regarding the possibility of teaching HPCC
  locally. We will wait if there is a follow-up interaction from them.

It feels that HPCC lessons seem to be only "one among many" lessons presented
in the workshop (or those developed by the attendees). But we also see our
unique niche to provide an effective intro to HPC with proven pedagogical
backing.

At this time, it appears to me (WP) that our best engagements have come from
the Carpentries community itself. Some HPC centers
