# HPCC Meeting, Apr. 4, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Conferences and Outreach

Both
[Carpentries Connect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/)
and [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) conferences have near-term
deadlines. By the meeting, folks should have looked at the conference websites
and have some idea what kind of engagement makes sense for us. In-person
attendance would be nice, but both conferences will have remote attendance
infrastructure also.

Also an update (if available) on SC24 plans would be good here.

For CarpentriesConnect, there's a
[call for proposals](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/02/cchd24-call-for-proposals/)
where the sessions are described, and there's a link to the form for actual
submission.

- Website: https://biont-training.eu/event-details/CarpentryConnect2024
- Dates: Nov 12-14, 2024

For RSECon24, the call for submissions is 2/5 of the way down the
[main page](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), and the four options are
"presentation", "panel", "interactive session", and "poster".

- Dates:

### The Website

Our main [website](https://hpc-carpentry.org) has gotten a bit stale over the
past while. This agenda item is motivated in part by some work that Alan O'Cais
already did getting the workshop list updated, but also it has come up at
various times in recent meetings.

The proposed task is to check in on progress on issues identified earlier, and
possibly identify new ones.

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught once! And there's a
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) on
it! It's currently in "draft" status pending a resolution of some attribution
issues. There was a plan for this at the [last meeting][nnnjj], has this been
executed? What are the other barriers to merging, and can we capture them in
the PR?

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. There are plans to do a workshop at
LLNL the week of June 30, and probably a NIST workshop a week or two later.

### Speaking Invitation

Scott Callaghan from the [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/)
chapter of the ACM has invited Andrew to give a talk about HPC Carpentry as
part of their speaker series. A recent update suggested working with Juan
Herrera from the EPCC on a joint conversation about producers and consumers of
the content. Details to be hammered out soon, with an expectation that this
will happen in late May or early June.

### Governance

Carried over from last time, where due to time it didn't get a ton of traction.

At the [last meeting][last-meeting], Andrew floated another crack at a
narrative, involving governance "owning the story" of the project, and
curriculum development as a kind of good-faith critic on behalf of the
audience. This was not well-formed, but could perhaps be developed further.
Feedback is welcome.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), University of Barcelona/CECAM

### Conferences and Outreach

#### SC24

SC24 has gotten a bit complicated because Alan, who was going to participate,
has other commitments. Janetta would still like to do something.

The submission is a bit involved, it requires examples of material. The plan
was to go from a MiniHPC cluster to a MiniHPC cluster that can run an HPC
Carpentry lesson.

Janetta can possibly identify someone else to attend, possibly the SSI could
help with this.

May connect with the South African folks who were doing VM-based cluster stuff?
To get more people in the room?

Janetta and Alan will follow up and maybe put something in.

#### CarpentryConnect

[Working on a submission for a breakout session](https://codimd.carpentries.org/E5xcpa4qRmWHHtRhUwt7Zg)

Alan and Marc-Andre had a call earlier today, they were thinking of a breakout
session. They have an obligation to deliver some content in the context of a
community event. So a reasonable path forward is to do a break-out session,
present the lesson program and talk about the ecosystem, and then follow up
with a workshop in October.

Message to convey: There is an HPC Carpentry "core curriculum", but it's
adjacent to a lot of nearby efforts.

As part of the messaging, try to get people to contribute to our core
curriculum.

#### RSEcon24

Andrew can put together a proposal for a presentation. Things can be presented
remotely. Janetta is also planning to do a MiniHPC activity at RSEcon24.

There's also a US RSE conference in October, can do the same abstract there.
Check the deadlines on that.

Include towards the end, include a "call to action", ID people at the
conference who people can talk to.

Deadline is April 30.

### The Website

There are some issues on the repo for the main website.

Maybe cut some of the stuff, e.g. blog posts, make it a bit leaner and easier
to maintain.

### Workflow Lesson Development

The giant PR merge has not happened yet. There's a new strategy to put a
citation file to put in the PR, and then it can be merged.

### Workshops

LLNL: They are paying for travel, week of June 3.

NIST: June 17 is the date.

Add these to the form!

### Speaking Invitation

Coordination with Weronika Fillinger is on-going. Late-May, early-June
time-frame.

SIGHPCeducation is working on a database of educational material.

In all of the foregoing, we will want to punch up the value of an open central
resource for fundamentals, that's self-correcting (via PRs) and workshop-based.

Sidebar: Marc-Andre re-iterates the need to integrate our material into
institutional contexts in order to make it relevant for them. The contrary
argument is to use generic cloud-based resources to convey the princples, with
the hope that this will give learners a running start on the real system.

Mechanism: Hooks to child documents? Would allow site-specific content without
triggering merge conflicts in git.

### Governance

No new reports.

### New business

There's a vulnerability on the Jetstream cluster, it needs to be rebuilt.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), Old Dominion University

### Workshops

For the LLNL workshop, Jane is interested in changing the workflow tool to
Maestro, to better-serve that user community. This is a fine idea, and/but will
require a bit of labor to get the lesson into shape. Jane has
[draft](https://xorjane.github.io/maestro-workflow-lesson/01-introduction.html)
of the lesson with a first cut at these changes.

Some discussion of travel logistics.

### Additional Conferences

#### US-RSE'24

- https://us-rse.org/usrse24/
- October 15-17, 2024, Albuquerque, NM

Deadline is June 3, 2024 for talks and posters.

- This community does not look like the one we need to target with high
  priority (not an HPC training/education community, but what we do should be
  relevant to research computing overall)
- But it may still be worth it to present to them what we are doing as a
  community --- so "Talk" sounds like an appropriate one.
- On poster: While idea of producing a poster seems to be nice, the poster
  sessions at conferences do not seem to be effective: they are not well
  planned, given the sufficient eminence that is due them, resulting in
  inadequate (i.e. not as well attended as it should be).
