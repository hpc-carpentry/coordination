# HPCC Meeting, Feb. 1, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of every month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Workflow lesson development

At the [last meeting][last-meeting], there was a bit of discussion on how this
was going. Alan has been working on the lesson, and ID'd some issues arising
from more recent versions of snakemake. It looks like we can work with v8
without serious breakage, so that's the current plan. Additional issues can be
discussed in this window.

### SCA2024

We've been invited to give a lightning talk as part of a larger educational
session at [Supercomputing Asia 2024](https://sca24.sc-asia.org/).

Andrew and Annajiat will put together a pre-recorded presenstation, due by
~~Feb. 5~~ Feb. 12, and attend remotely for the Q&A.

Hopefully by the time of this meeting, there will be a script and some slides,
and we can get feedback from the team.

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. Annajiat has an on-going effort, Alan
has the February CECAM one, and there is a possibility of an LLNL workshop in
the late spring, as well as probably a NIST workshop in more or less the same
time-frame.

This is terrific news, and merits some discussion of logistics.

### Governance

Carried over from last time, where due to time it didn't get a ton of traction.

Now that we are out from the holiday disruptions and have a bit of time to
think, we should probably re-engage with the governance issue. If we're going
to be in the Carpentries umbrella, we will want to ensure that our lessons
continue to abide by Carpentries guidelines, and that contributors feel
welcome. We will also want to be in a posiiton where we can track our
activities and demonstrate impact, which will require some reporting and
book-keeping, which some entity should own.

### Bioinformatics

This item is pending from earlier meetings, updates appreciated.

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US department of agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

### Workflow Lesson Development

A draft version of the lesson exists, there were some challenges getting things
arranged correctly. There's no PR yet, but there will be one soon.

The lesson includes an explanation for why you need to set the width of the
thing by means of a function in the Python, it has to do with the order of
operations of Snakemake, the wildcards get instantiated at start-time, and in
order to defer the instantiation to run-time (which we need to do what we
want), you need to do the function thing. This is now described in the lesson.

The draft lesson is [online](https://ocaisa.github.io/hpc-workflows/).

There are two kinds of parallelism in the workflow, there's the parallelism
within the Snakemake process, where rules can run concurrently, and also the
parallelism of the actual Amdahl tasks themselves, which execute in MPI
parallel on the nodes.

Question: Should the snakemake lesson have a "rules in parallel" step as a
separate snakefile, after the "out-of-order" one and before the cluster one?
Possibly do-able, there's a time constraint for the upcoming workshop, but
there's a place in the lesson where this makes sense.

Re-raised the question of whether to have a prerequisite of Python programming.
The snakefile has a lambda function body written in Python, which is not
conceptually trivial.

TODO: Go look at the lesson.

### SCA 2024

The recording deadline has moved to Feb. 12.

Showed an outline. Annajiat suggests we might consider mentioning that Python
and Java are used in HPC, people tend to be surprised by this, and having that
be more widely known broadens the potential audience.

Ending with a "call for action" is a good idea. A complication of this is that
when we do get contributions, there tends to be a bit of a delay before there's
a reply. Maybe emphasize the volunteer-ness of the effort.

### Workshops

CECAM is teed up, LLNL organization is happening, and probably there will be
another NIST workshop in the late-May or early-June time-frame.

Craig Gross was not able to execute his planned HPC Intro workshop, and has a
constraint where the largest window they can open in their calendar is about
three hours.

### Governance

Thinking about this from a money angle -- what would we do if we had money, how
would we justify a request for money and how would we benefit from purchasing
someone's labor, and then having that person go away. One possible example
might be translating the HPC Intro lesson to the Carpentries Workbench, which
is an identifiable product that someone could produce.

But maybe not, the translation involves implicit design choices, and in
particular there are issues around tabs and snippets, where getting the content
to render is in tension with making it easy for people to contribute.

#### Things to work on

Per Toby,

- lesson infrastructure development
- workshop administration
- community building
- preparing ground for joining Carpentries, e.g. developing Instructor
  onboarding, writing documentation for how to run workshops, etc
- "market research" - who needs the training, where are they, and do they have
  money/in-kind resources to contribute?

#### Possible task

The Jetstream2 folks have a Magic Castle button you can push, could we
collaborate with them to build a version of this that stands up an HPC
Carpentry lesson also, to facilitate people doing their own workshops.

Having a workflow that's instrumented would allow "us" to see how often it's
used, which would help us to demonstrate impact.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto
- Jane Herriman

### Workflow Lesson Development

Discussion of concerns about the workflow lesson as written going on to the
cluster maybe a bit too soon, and exacerbating the issue where
snakemake-concurrency parallelism and MPI parallelism are hard to disentangle
for learners. A reason for going to the cluster early is to avoid the bad
practice of running on the head node, but one could get on the cluster via an
interactive session, and satisfy both good cluster practices _and_ distinctions
between kinds of parallelism.

Example for SLURM (5-hour session):

```
srun -t 5:00:00 --pty /bin/bash
```

### Snakefile ain't your usual program

Idea: Devise a two-rule snakefile where it demonstrates the point that
Snakefile rules

Demonstrate:

- a rule won't run if the target file has existed
- rules run in order of dependency, not in the order of appearance

### Disentagling parallelisms

Snakemake has its own concurrency (if two or more rules are independent and can
be executed concurrently); and MPI has its own way of parallelism. Concern:
Will learners confuse the two?

### SCA'24 Presentation outline

Will follow similar contents as that presented in [BPHTE'23]()

Some things we want to point out (unique to HPC Carpentry, not in regular
Carpentries per se):

- Two tracks of lessons:

  - HPC users track--lessons in existence or available for testing
  - HPC developers track--lessons are still in conceptual stage

- points of tension between "no blackbox" vs focus on the target pedagogy
  - Example: using graybox "amdahl.py" code for illustrating parallel
    invocation, Amdahl's law, etc. instead of getting into the detail of MPI
    program

Challenges:

- Finding learners
- Having a cluster to run the workshop
  - curently using Jetstream2 allocation to fill this need
  - need expertise to stand out and troubleshoot HPC cluster
  -

Things we want from the community:

- "Call for action".

### Finding ~~Nemo~~ Learners

Q: Have you talked with other national labs regarding the need of
Carpentries-like lesson? When we talked to them (e.g. Oak Ridge, etc) they seem
to be happy with their existing training materials. Why is this?

- Maybe because they do not have novice users (e.g. LCF [Leadership Computing
  Facilities] are really not for novice).
- Or the percentage of novice people in some of these labs are so small; so
  their needs are underrepresented?

But some other labs may have novice users (e.g. LLNL with the constant streams
of interns)---they can benefit.

Maybe, while we are at LLNL, also present a talk to NERSC?

- LLNL has fewer user base (say 1000) and many of them are power users
- NERSC seems to have more new users. Their user base is much larger than LLNL

NERSC staff directory: https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/

How about universities? They seem to be obvious pool of potential consumers of
HPC-carpentry materials as they constantly have new users that are uninitiated
to high-tech HPC materials. But apparently many universities feel ok with the
materials they already have. Is that really the case, or do they miss
something?

Other sites of interest to talk regarding HPC Carpentries include:

- SDSC (San Diego CA)
- TACC (Austin TX)

These sites have large number of new users all the time, so they pay good
attention to training. (Brainstorming of people to reach out at these sites.)

### "What to do if you have money?"

Some potential outlets:

- Outreach
- Website maintenance & adding of new contents
- Converting hpc-intro lesson to the new lesson template
- Permanent HPC Carpentry cluster in the cloud
- Governance

New Jetstream2 cluster is up: jetstream2.hpc-carpentry.org/ . Contact Alan for
credentials.
