# HPCC Meeting, June 20, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This is a good time to review the requirements, and perhaps chat with
Carpentries reps, if they are present, or schedule a call with them.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

The [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/) talk happened, some
thing were learned. Recording available at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0rf3Fyh7M&ab_channel=ChairSIGHPCEducation

This slot is for general discussion of this sort of thing.

Are we going to participate in SC24? BoF closes on JUL 5, 2024.
[link](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/program/birds-of-a-feather/). Topics:
Democratization of HPC, Education and Workforce Development.

### The Website

We had a co-working meeting
[May 30](https://codimd.carpentries.org/vxPFtsRXRYy5vw5Qd6W3_Q), where a bit of
progress was made in cleaning up the lesson lists on the
[main website](https://hpc-carpentry.org). There is still lots to do!

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

### Workshops

The NIST workshop is still pending, timing uncertain.

### Carpentries Workbench port

Alan put a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of
the HPC Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for
the snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is
a bit noisy.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Dimitrios Theodorakis (he/him), Met Office
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle University, UK
- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- Annajiat Alim Rasel
- Wirawan Purwanto, Old Dominion University

### Carpentries Incubation

Andrew briefly summarized the requirements at the
[link](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation).

Key requirements:

1. [Policies and Processes](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#policies-and-processes)
2. [Governance](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#governance)
3. [Contributions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#contributions)
4. [Teaching](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#teaching)
5. [Supplementary Materials (optional but recommended)](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#supplementary-materials-optional-but-recommended)

Challenges that might be hard for us include the community-building piece,
which has been challenging for us in the past, it's related to identifying our
audience and running some workshops for them. Andrew also thinks the governnace
will have a natural solution if the other items are worked out correctly.

It's a nominal 18-month timeline, this is likely approximate, but should
nevertheless be taken seriously.

Something the Carpentries is looking for is confirmation that we think the
deadline makes sense.

#### Surveying community?

(In the context of the most challenging part of the requirements: community
interest / engagement / building.)

(WP's thought) Regarding community building, community interest & traction: In
a different project, someone proposed a survey for a similar inquiry. Idea:
Maybe survey the HPC education communty, centers we know of, and see if we can
identify a need for what HPC Carpentry has to offer. Could this be a good way
to find responses and find community's attitude regarding the HPC Carpentry?

Potential target community: HPC pros / training+education communities (e.g.
Champions, CaRCC).

Concern with surveys: We only get the most vocal voices, thus the result may
not represent the community as a whole.

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

#### Action Items for Incubation

Immediate action item: The steering commmittee should draft an e-mail reply to
the anouncement, confirming the date in writing.

Next step might be to set up some kind of proejct milestones in the
coordination repo for each of the steps.

Side item: Toby has a place-holder for a July 10 blog post about this. We can
point to that to help raise awareness and get our message out, requesting
action from people who have read it, like workshops, lesson contribution, and
so forth. It would be good to have concrete asks for this.

### Lesson Development of HPC-Intro

Mentioned the offshoot of HPC-intro at (a university) which have been ported to
Workbench. The purpose of that HPC-intro lesson on that university

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

Andrew need to talk with the

Toby's input regarding lesson: "I don't believe lessons should be treated as
scripts to be stuck to no matter what: great instruction means adapting to the
motivations and prior knowledge of the audience in the room."

### Livermore Workshop Takeaway

Workshop was held two weeks ago. Some tidbits:

- Format: two-days workshop format
- num of participants: 15 for the first, 12 for the second.
- Teaching: Trevor, Andrew, Jane (Maestro port of the (new) workflow lesson)
- level of incoming skills

  - general level of skills of the learners is high
  - audience was sharp; some with prior experience of using HPC but lacking
    necessary mental model of what was going on. Some were total novice to HPC.
  - get good questions

- Q: What was (were) learned by us from this workshop?

- Regarding workflow lesson: It looks like the lesson is quite easy to port to
  specific target(?). Andrew feels like the

- Feedback? Missing pre-workshop survey. Post-workshop survey existed + the
  responses. We also had stickies, Trevor and Andrew will review them.

### Conferences and Outreach

**CarpentryConnect (CCHD24)** Marc-Andre and Alan are on for CarpentryConnect,
it's early yet, no real update, but Marc-Andre is working on a poster.

CCHD24 call for proposal:
https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/02/cchd24-call-for-proposals/ (CCHD24 =
CarpentryConnect and BioNT Community Event - Heidelberg 2024)

**RSECon24** abstract was rejected. Probably the reviewer feedback would shed
light (or not?) -- Andrew will retrieve the full review later.

**USRSE** abstract was submitted, with a single presenter (Andrew) listed, and
with no obvious way to indicate that it's remote.

**PEARC'24** Not in the agenda, but it's not clear what if anything became of
the PEARC activity -- Andrew shared the SCA2024 lightning talk with the person
who asked about it. (PEARC activity was mentioned by: Clark Gaylord, George
Washington University -- from the May 16th meeting
https://codimd.carpentries.org/_o4l4BH5SN6JUWLicXv4Cw#)

**SC24**: Wirawan is planning on going, has his own material to present. BoF
deadline is still open, it's July 5. Maybe connect with the SIGHPC or other
education efforts?

(An alternative, could be easier to handle than BOF) **BPHTE24**: "Eleventh SC
Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education"
https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/ Abstract due aug 12, the
most late deadline.

### The Website

There are a bunch of issues, engagement would be welcome, the co-working on May
30 was somewhat productive in this regard.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him) NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her) LLNL

### More LLNL followup

Jane says there's another workflow tool, "Merlin", also from LLNL, that's more
involved than Maestro, and which can do restarts, but requires to be connected
to a Redis server in order to operate, and runs on top of Maestro (and Celery).

Need to transcribe stickies at some point!
