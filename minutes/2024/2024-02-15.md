# HPCC Meeting, Feb. 15, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught once! And there's a
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) on
it! If it hasn't been merged already, this is a good opportunity for a more
detailed discussion of lessons learned and paths forward. If it _has_ been
merged, we can still have that conversation.

### SCA2024

Our recorded lightning talk for
[Supercomputing Asia 20204](https://sca24.sc-asia.org/) has been submitted. It
remains to get details on the timing, the Zoom link, and then be there for the
Q&A period.

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. Annajiat has an on-going effort, Alan
had the February CECAM one, and there is a possibility of an LLNL workshop in
the late spring, as well as probably a NIST workshop in more or less the same
time-frame.

Related to this, there was some discussion at the [last meeting][last-meeting]
about building a Magic Castle set-up that automates the set-up of a full HPCC
workshop on cloud infrastructure. Are there any action items on that?

### Bioinformatics

This item is pending from earlier meetings, updates appreciated.

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US department of agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

### Speaking Invitation

Scott Callaghan from the [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/)
chapter of the ACM has invited Andrew to give a talk about HPC Carpentry as
part of their speaker series, possibly paired with another speaker who has used
the material, which the organizers have volunteered to find. This sounds like
an excellent idea, but it doesn't have to be Andrew who does it.

Timing remains uncertain, we are in the early stages of this conversation.

### Governance

Carried over from last time, where due to time it didn't get a ton of traction.

Now that we are out from the holiday disruptions and have a bit of time to
think, we should probably re-engage with the governance issue. If we're going
to be in the Carpentries umbrella, we will want to ensure that our lessons
continue to abide by Carpentries guidelines, and that contributors feel
welcome. We will also want to be in a posiiton where we can track our
activities and demonstrate impact, which will require some reporting and
book-keeping, which some entity should own.

Related to this, there was a brief discussion in the second lession of the
[last meeting][last-meeting] about possible outreach directions we might
pursue, and uses to which we might put money, if we were to obtain some. These
are worthwhile discussions for the earlier group as well.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais
- Craig Gross (he/him), Michigan State University
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Annajiat Alim Rasel, Brac University
- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries

### Workflow Lesson

"After-action" from the CECAM workshop. Feedback was minimal, but positive,
many/most learners were able to complete all of the activities. Feedback was
only available through the CodiMD shared note-taking tool, because of the
on-line character of the workshop.

The instructors used [shellshare](https://shellshare.net), a tool that puts the
instructor's command-line shell up on the web for learners to view. On day 1,
there was a tool that showed the last four commands in the history, and this
was absent on day 2, and was noticed. It's tricky, because the tool doesn't
survive jumping around between machines, which is of course a big part of this
activity.

There seems to be a big cognitive jump associated with the lambda function,
which for Snakemake 8 seems to be required.

There were a few "cheat codes", Snakemake and Amdahl were installed on the
cluster already, so the download and installation steps were elided.

There's also a potentially high barrier to migrating the lesson to a non-SLURM
system. Snakemake is very SLURM-friendly and SLURM-aware, but possibly all the
required changes might be confined to the cluster config file, and not the main
workflow.

For resources, it's maybe useful to just have one cluster per lesson, and use
the Magic Castle tools to stand up and tear down.

There are some issues with the HPC Intro lesson, the `curl` command in the
lesson is broken -- needs `-L` to follow redirects, otherwise it downloads
nothing. (Is `wget` more resilient? - It is but less commonly available than
`curl`)

Problems with set-up, many learners had problems with the SSH key and setup.

Technical issue: If you try to do the multi-node workflow from JupyterHub
interface, it doesn't work, there's some problems with the environment
variables that SLURM sets, you need to anticipate this.

There's a [PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14)
encapsulating some of this.

Follow-up issues: Attribution is necessary. Where to put the information?
Should it be episode by episode, or just a summary somewhere?

It should definitely be at the top level `README.md`, but maybe also
highlighted at the point where it's used? If it's an extensive remix of the
borrowed content (as indeed seems to be the case), then it's sufficient to
describe this.

#### Path Forward (for Michigan State near-term, and others)

Question about whether this is useful as a stand-alone lesson. The answer is
that there is a bit of call-back, besides the skill prerequisites, there's as
assumption that the learners have at least seen and maybe run the `amdahl` code
before and know what it's about. But the code is introduced, so this is maybe
not a barrier.

(Lesson instruction
[HackMD](https://biont.biobyte.de/gsJdmI2ZQxSrh_8DRI2eUg?view) is available.)

Craig will give this a shot, and see how much friction there seems to be in
porting this to the MSU site.

Which priorities for the PR? Setting up the editor so tabs translate to spaces
might be useful, Snakemake expects spaces. The EESSI environment provides all
the stuff, so that's a thing to do.

Question about the use of Conda and Snakemake. Snakemake supports but
discourages the use of environment modules, prefers Conda or containers, for
reproducibility and portability. This isn't really robust for "us", our
environment actually is quite portable, that's the point of EESSI.

Craig will also have a look at the various issues, also.

### SCA2024

We have a time slot for the recording, it's not obvious if the Q&A Zoom link is
going to be available, and the fall-back is an e-mail address that people can
use to send questions. There is the Topicbox, but it's public, so not
appropriate. Can we set up a relay?

Toby H. says `maintainers-hpc+admins@lists.carpentries.org` only goes to the
admins on the associated list. Not clear if the steering committee are all
admins on this list, but that's fixable.

Maybe we can get a `carpentries.org` domain address? Opens a conversation about
the next steps in the incubation process, which is also timely and useful. It
would be an interface to a Google group.

Other lesson programs use a thing called "helpscout", which is sort of a
ticket-like system.

For ticketing, Gitlab has a thing that we could perhaps use.

### Workshops

They are still coming up. MSU is thinking of doing something soon, but things
have gotten busy, it's still on the TODO list.

### Bioinformatics

Elided because Benson is not available today, and is lead on it.

### Speaking Invitation

We think this is a good idea. Weronika Fillinger from EPCC says she knows
people who have used the material, and that a two-fold presentation of hte
material and folks who have used it.

### Governance

Shared or institutional resources -- currently various individuals own various
pieces of the infrastructure, we should fix that.

Gitlab is an interesting tool, it has a
[Service Desk](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk/) tool that
automatically creates tickets and issues, in a private scope, which can be made
public later if you want. An advantage of Gitlab over GitHub is this kind of
private capability.

The CloudFlare set-up we have that manages the `hpc-carpentry.org` domain can
have e-mails that redirect e.g. to the Gitlab service desk, so
`steering@hpc-carpentry.org` could be created that does this.

It's not possible to have a collective own the CloudFlare capability, it has to
be an entity that can pay for things. Maybe in the glorious future, this will
be owned by the Carpentries? This is possibly not the really-right answer,
since e.g. the Terraform stuff needs to edit the zone file to stand up e.g.
cluster.hpc-carpentry.org, and stuff like that.

For SCA2024, we should do something else, the Glorious Future isn't here yet.
The `maintainers-hpc+admin@lists.carpentries.org` thing works now, assuming the
list of recipients is correct. Toby: recommend trying to remove Christina and
Andy before the conference session

Additional item: The
[Carpentries handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-program-incubation-roadmap)
has a description of related activies, viz:

During the Incubation phase, The Carpentries will:

- Provide the Lesson Project with access to our database system (currently AMY)
  for workshop tracking
- Allow the use of our survey infrastructure (currently Typeform)
- Post information on The Carpentries website regarding the Incubation of the
  Lesson Project as well as through other communication channels and at
  instructor training workshops
- Provide a Carpentries team member to meet with the Lesson Project for
  feedback or advice on a regular basis, with the frequency to be determined
  mutually by the Lesson Project and The Carpentries.

The database thing isn't do-able currently, access is "all or nothing", and
it's inappropriate (and a GDPR violation) to give us access to everyone else's
data.

The survey thing is doable.

Website stuff: Do a blog post, make a more formal announcement and build some
links between the sites, and put these meetings on to the Carpentries Community
calendar, by way of "passive outreach".

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL
- Trevor Keller
- Jannetta Steyn

### Workflow Lesson

Had its first run.

The big takeaway for me is that Alan found there was a big congnitive jump in
describing the lambda that is used to set the width of the parallel rule at
run-time. This requires some careful attention going forward.

The as-taught lesson is
[here](https://ocaisa.github.io/hpc-workflows/index.html)

Question for Jane Herriman at LLNL: Can we expect Snakemake 8 to be on the LLNL
cluster for our activity there in the spring? Snakemake is currently not on
offer at LLNL, apparently? It could be installed for the class. (Not a lot of
usage, but [AiiDA][aiida], LLNL [Maestro][maestro], [Merlin][merlin] (Maestro
overlay for AI/ML).)

[aiida]: https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/
[maestro]: https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/maestro-workflow-conductor
[merlin]: https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/merlin

Alternatively, we could think about a different tool that's more relevant to
the LLNL community? This isn't essential, we believe the lesson is good at
conveying general workflow-tool concepts using snakemake as an example, so we
don't _have_ to change it.

Workflow tools at LLNL typically have Redis intermediary layers, so there's a
bunch of set-up to make that happen, maybe a per-learner operation.

Action items: Jane will check the ticketing system and see if there have been
requests, and also install it locally and see if the lesson can be executed.

### SCA2024

Recap similar to the morning.

### Workshops

LLNL is coming up, see the workflow discussion above for some of that.

MSU might also be coming up, and we'll likely be doing a NIST thing.

LLNL will go up on their events website.

### Bioinformatics

Elided in the early session and the later session.

### Speaker invitation

SIGHPC Education.

### Governance

Collective resources were under discussion.

### New Business

The website continues to have issues. There's a "Help Wanted" section on there,
and it's pretty stale. Also it's generally hard to navigate, and makes us look
bad. We could maybe co-work this in a dedicated session.
