# HPCC Meeting, August 1, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

The deadline for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24, sponsored by the sIGHPC Education chapter of the ACM is August 12. We
should probably do something for that, preferrably something a little different
from last year.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

An abstract has been submitted to the HPC BoF at
[RSEcon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), see the
[Slack message](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C04AV65FUPR/p1719223728893559)
from Andy Turner.

The submitted text can be found on the
[shared Codi document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/jVqstrnNQXCjH8cjMFChsA),
scroll down to "as-submitted" to see what was done.

#### Workshops

None pending.

### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

Andrew promised to lay out some design criteria and a design for the website,
but this has not happened yet.

### Older issues

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

We got some
PRs[1](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/454)[2](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/453)
from EPCC! This is cross-fork collaboration!

Following up from both last meeting and the SIGHPC Education activity, Alan put
a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of the HPC
Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for the
snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is a
bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle University
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/UB
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito

### Random Housekeeping Item

There are standard Zoom rooms that the Carpentries generally uses, we should
perhaps move these meetings to that? Solves the problem of NIST ownership of
the Google Meet environment, also. Look up how to do this. For regular events,
there's a calendar, and for things outside of the standard calls, reach out to
Toby and something can be set up.

**_ACTION:_** Toby will switch future HPCC community calls (after the two
today) to use Zoom.

### Carpentries Incubation

Anything we need to change about our meeting/admin workflow? Alan: open an
issue/issues to track the things we need to do. Good task for a kanban or
GitHub Project. Possibly in the coordination repo.

Additional item: The blog post came in the middle of vacation season. We should
make an excuse to re-up the blog post or something like it to gain some
visibility and hopefully reconnect with interested people.

Alan: I have a workshop coming up in October, good chance to write about that,
BioNT project, etc.

Related to the website item farther down in the agenda, the other lesson
program websites have been pared down and redesigned, so that's a solid
starting point for looking at what we want to do. Some mismatches, official
lesson programs participate in a group blog so there are no individual blog
posts, but we are not there yet. Suggestion for blog posts: Target the
Carpentries blog, but cross-post to our site for now?

Alan thinks we should deactivate our blog, it's a bad look to have it present
and stale.

Andrew has a Livermore blog post still to be finished. This one might actually
be better for just our blog, and suggests keeping the blog and getting more
active with it.

**_ACTION:_** Toby will ask Community Engagement Team if lesson-specific blog
posts like the pending LLNL one are appropriate for the Carpentries blog.

### Conferences and Outreach

Andrew: we should put together an abstract for a "lessons learned" paper to be
presented at SC24. Not sure if anyone is already planning to go? Alan: a bit of
effort to get a paper together, although they do not need to be long. Andrew:
reports from lightning talks in the past required some slightly difficult LaTeX
templating, but otherwise it was ok. Bigger problem may be that deadline is 12
August! Alan: they usually extend, but that should not be relied on.

**_ACTION:_** Andrew will create a draft and share it on slack.

Other conference items: We are on for USRSE and CarpentryConnect. The HPC BoF
of RSECon24 is still pending.

#### Speaking of outreach

There were a couple of PRs against the HPC Intro lesson
[1](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/453)
[2](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/454) from UCL,
which are part of a
[broader effort](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/hpc-intro/issues/34), opening up
all the issues about snippets and migration to the Carpentries workbench.

Maybe more explicit outreach to both UCL-ARC and EPCC to participate in our
calls and dedicate some agenda time to working through these issues. Workbench
changes and snippets implicate the core team.

Benson: Maybe different kinds of meetings, some less-frequent meetings that are
focused on collaboration, and more-frequent meetings to focus on
less-interactive work?

Alan: Others have HPC Carpentry workshops, including using the name. How fussy
do we want to be about this? We should definitely engage with them.

**_ACTION:_** Andrew is in this loop, will reach back out to the contributor
and SIGHPC co-presenter to try to coordinate changes.

**_ACTION:_** Toby will reach out to Eirini Zormpa at UNIVERSE-HPC to discuss
use of hpc-intro and potential for cross-pollination between the two projects.

Benson: Also reach out to Department of Agriculture? Andrew: brief conversation
with USDA did not make clear how directly relevant the materials are. Benson:
their institutional model might make things tricky. May be true of other
agencies that use HPC. They hold Carpentries workshops, and suspect they are
not alone. But different constaints from typical academic institutions. It
would be helpful to figure out what could excite them about HPCC and whether we
could make that happen.

**_ACTION:_** Benson(?) to reach out to folks at USDA and see if we can engage
them in further discussion.

#### Workshops

Alan has a workshop coming up in October, so there is something pending.

Related, we got an extension on the Jetstream2 ACCESS allocation. It turns out
that getting an extension is pretty easy, or at least was this time. Also
possible to collaborate directly with the Jetstream2 folks. Throw the
Carpentries name around?

#### Sidebar about usage of the JetStream2

Benson has a [pdbR lesson](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/HPC-R/) on R that might
make sense on this resource, provided it's HPC Carpentry content. There's a
technical issue, the cluster is set up for HPC Intro and core curriculum, it
would take some effort to adapt it to a different lesson.

The software environment is delivered by EESSI, so a good path forward is to
get the relevent packages submitted to that, and then the existing
infrastructure will work more easily. It's not completely obvious how well
R-Studio will work in EESSI, but that's the next thing to investigate.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jose Nino Muriel (he/him), University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB)
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

Chat with Jose Niño Muriel, and his colleague Jay Chi. Jose is a novice in HPC
but interested in The Carpentries, and Jay is an HPC expert. They are
interested in how they can possibly help us get adopted, and how we can help
their institution. One possibility is that the institution might have people
who are both Carpentries Instructors and HPC experts.

Question about what resource to use to run the cluster? We have the Jetstream2
allocation that is our default expectation, but that we can adapt the lesson to
a local facility if a workshop host has one they want to use, as we have done
at LLNL and NIST.

Question from Jay Chi about who is our audience. Novice HPC users, including
mid-career investigators new to HPC or early-career learners.

Some _waxing philosophical_ discussion about the Carpentries method, pacing,
and so forth, including the value of muscle memory and vocabulary.

### Outreach Addendum

Clark Gaylord did go to PEARC, mentioned HPC Carpentry from time to time, and
got a good reception.

Possibility of joining a call and/or doing a presentation on HPC Carpentry for
the ACCESS Campus Champion group. Clark is in the process of becoming a Campus
Champion for GWU.

Should HPC Carpentry present to [CASC](https://casc.org)? We could perhaps do a
lightning talk at some meeting at some point? Attendees think this is not
insane.
