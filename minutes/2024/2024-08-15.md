# HPCC Meeting, August 15, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia,
  and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_late], better for the Americas
  and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Both meetings will use Zoom, with separate links for the two sessions, one for
the [early][zoom_early] session, and one for the [later][zoom_late] session.

To join by phone, dial a
[local phone number](https://carpentries.zoom.us/u/keypRGGgJd), and then key in
the meeting ID and passcode. The meeting IDs are `824 315 0376` for the earlier
meeting, and `271 847 9229` for the later one. The passcode is `202020` for
both meetings.

[**Lesson Program Incubation: Roadmap and Status on GitHub**][inc-proj]

Please review the kanban board & roadmap often: this is the path to Carpentries
membership!!!

---

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

The deadline for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24, sponsored by the SIGHPC Education chapter of the ACM was August 12, we
got a submission in. There's a
[CodiMD](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA) with the
as-submitted abstract, and also with a link to the
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/66ba1c90a58bd341df753b2f) where the
extended abstract (and nucleus of the eventual paper?) exists. The manuscript
deadline is Sept. 9, assuming the abstract is accepted.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

The abstract submitted to the HPC BoF at
[RSEcon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) (submitted text can be found on
the
[shared Codi document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/jVqstrnNQXCjH8cjMFChsA),
scroll down to "as-submitted") was rejected.

#### Outreach

Andrew promised to get in touch with the UCL folks from the cross-fork PRs, and
see if there is more coordination to be done. There probably is!

Toby promised to reach out to Erini Zormpa at UNIVERSE-HPC to explore the
possibility of cross-pollination between the projects.

Benson promised to reach out to USDA.

Alan Ã“Cais mentioned in the Slack about the [HPC-ED](https://hpc-ed.github.io)
project, probably worth a look and maybe reaching out or listing ourselves or
something.

#### Workshops

Toby is drafting pre- and post-workshop surveys for HPC Carpentry, to be
incorporated into The Carpentries' existing survey/assessment infrastructure &
processes. Would like some input on how questions need to be adjusted to
support assessment of HPC Carpentry.

- [pre-workshop survey questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2zwa-SOpSq7UbI6l-ubY3fYW--CfTdNPVlqSGLuS7o/edit?usp=sharing)
- [post-workshop survey questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1srbxMzQtV9PUZa4v63f67x5pb20czlwIPp_Z-49A0Lo/edit?usp=sharing)

### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Older issues

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

We got some
PRs[1](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/454)[2](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/453)
from ~~EPCC~~ UCL! This is cross-fork collaboration!

Following up from both last meeting and the SIGHPC Education activity, Alan put
a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of the HPC
Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for the
snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is a
bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Jannetta Steyn
- Benson Muite
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Carpentries Incubation

### Conferences

BPHTE'24 abstract is in! Quite an effort. Manuscript is due Sept. 9, which is
very soon!

HPC BoF at RSECon'24 was rejected.

### Outreach

The UCL/EPCC outreach has not happened yet.

Erini Zormpa will be at RSECon24, so the plan is for Toby to meet with her
then, with some planning.

The LLNL blog post is done! **ACTION: Toby will work with Oscar to get this
cross-posted to carpentries.org/blog/**

We should dig in to the HPC-ED activity from the Slack.

Email contact with USDA has been made.

Use this link to get an invitation to join The Carpentries Slack workspace:
https://slack-invite.carpentries.org/

### Workshops

There is an annotated pre-workshop survey.

The HPC resources question is useful for instructors to know e.g. whether the
workshop needs to be generalizable to other clusters, or can/should be tailored
to a particular resource. This might also be relevant outside the immediate
context of the workshop, so learner surveys may be complementary to information
that can be obtained from the workshop hosting institution.

Also, one of the models we have in our heads is that there's a "long tail" of
potential HPC users who don't have access to a resource, and for whom e.g.
ACCESS or cloud infrastructure is high-value. Cumulative answers over many
workshops to the HPC Resources question would shed some light on this.
Likewise, if people with ACCESS allocations are coming to us a lot, this maybe
indicates a gap in ACCESS training that we are filling.

For responder attitudes, a few more questions (maybe up to 3) that expand the
scope to include HPC would be good. OK for these to be HPC-specific, it's
harmless to include questions that might be out of scope for non-HPC workshops,
this is a side-effect of using the same pre-workshop survey.

Questions should be more about attitudes than technical expertise: what
understanding do we want learners to come away with?

**_ACTION:_** Everybody, go review the surveys and think about how to tailor
the questions for an HPC audience.

Additional upcoming workshops:

- Alan has one coming up in October.

It would be good to have the survey questions in time for that.

### The Website

Andrew still has an action item to check out the other Carpentries websites and
assess what changes might be needed to their design for us. We probably want a
separate blog-post function, for one thing, and there may be other deviations.

### New Business

Not captured last time, but it would be a good idea to stand up some kind of
project board or something that would help track our progress towards the
various to-do items that will complete the incubation process.

Toby says he's willing to stand up some tracking infrastructure
([DONE](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2)), but
documenting the items and progress is really on the steering commitee.

#### New organization-level project: [Lesson Program Incubation][inc-proj]

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Andrew Pauling, University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto, Old Dominion University
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute
- Jane Herriman, LLNL

### Introduction of New People

Two new participants came to the meeting. They are members of the Carpentries
instructors community interested in training materials for HPC. (Please CIMMW
below)

Andrew Pauling: had prior experience of using HPC at the University of
Washington. Now in New Zealand, he has observed much struggle for people who
are using HPC caused by lack of expertise.

Jean Chang has been with the Carpentries community since ~2019: The local HPC
cluster was using LSF. Then now using Grid Engine. In the process of adopting
SLURM for the upcoming upgraded cluster. Thus the HPC Carpentry intro to HPC
lesson looks relevant to this transition.

### Carpentries Incubation

Brief discussion of the new project management infrastructure on Github, and
the incubation activities.

### Submission of BPHTE'24 Abstract

Extended abstract was composed in a hurry on Aug 12. For public archive of the
submitted abstract (later also paper), see
https://github.com/wirawan0/BPHTE24-HPCC-paper . Clarification: This is not
meant to be _the_ authoritative working location. We are using Overleaf for our
manuscript writing. Please keep using that.

### Recap History of HPC Carpentry

- Peter Steinbach "HPC in a day" (he's now at Helmholtz-Zentrum
  Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR))
- Compute Canada
- At SC'23 => We had successful engagement with the community (lightning talk
  at BPHTE'23 workshop, and contacts with people relevant to our effort). A lot
  of additional engagements we have right now were spurred from that time.

### Outreach: HPC-ED

Wirawan is familiar with the [HPC-ED](https://hpc-ed.github.io/) activity, he
says it's a US NSF funded activity
([Award #2320977](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2320977)) to
not host, but rather to index, HPC training materials. It serves as a community
portal in which _people will be able to discover the suitable training
materials (at the right level) more easily_. It's not clear how to engage with
this project, but there is a [Google Group](https://hpc-ed.github.io/) mailing
list that might be an engagement pathway.

Some interesting stuff they put out:

- Link to Alpha catalog for HPC-ED
  https://search-pilot.operations.access-ci.org/hpc-ed-v1/?q=*

There's also a Google form you can fill out to engage, it's the "Let Us Know"
link on the main page. Sharing links is a bit oblique for Carpentries, where
the in-person delivery of workshop material is the point. The website and
materials support the workshop, but they are not the workshop.

### Promoting HPC Carpentry Program

For the upcoming BPHTE'24 workshop presentation, we may want to put emphasis on
the strength + positive impact of _the Carpentries workshop format_ (rather
than just the bare HPC Carpentry lessons). What about emphasizing our recent
workshop experiences (e.g. the one complete workshop conducted)

- How did it go?
- What are the prevailing responses from the learners?
- Any impacts on people's understanding and correct utilization of HPC?

Other _partial_ data points may include: NIST's offerings of "Intro to HPC" to
their users. Interesting observations: NIST users do not have Unix Shell
experience, so the workshop goes slower than what went on Livermore.

One challenge we want to address with HPC Carpentry lesson program to make
introductory lessons that can help novice truly understands what HPC system is,
the workflow of its operation, and how to use it properly. Many "intro to HPC"
lessons about out there, written by many site operators; but the question is,
do learners leave with the correct working knowledge?

### HPC Carpentry Website

The website has grown organically, it has accumulated crufts. In the

- What should be on the website?
- Andrew Reid will try the first cut between now and the next meeting.
- If you have ideas about what needs to be placed on the HPC-Carpentry website,
  please speak up now (write to HPCC mailing list)
- We will keep:
  - The blog
  - Catalog of the lesson contents

### Discussion with Newcomers

Andrew Pauling would like to teach the HPC Carpentry materials.

Two lines of workshops we are fostering according to the strategic plan:

- The "HPC users" workshop (encompassing Unix Shell, Intro to HPC, and
  [HPC Workflow Management with Snakemake](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-workflows/))

- The "HPC developers" workshop (will include parallel programming e.g. MPI, pi
  calculation ... ?)
