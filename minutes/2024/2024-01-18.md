# HPCC Coordination Meeting, January 18, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### HPC Cluster Migration

The project that supports the AWS cluster at `cluster.hpc-carpentry.org` has
ended and the cluster will go away soon. There are near-term plans to stand up
a new one on the ACCESS Jetstream 2 resource to which we have access. This
agenda item is for that conversation, including thinking through policies for
on-going access.

### Workflow lesson development

At the [last coordination meeting (Dec 2023)][last-coord], it was sort of
informally agreed that Alan would take the lead on the workflow lesson
development, since he has a good familiarity with the tools and a near-term
requirement. This agenda item is an opportunity to see if there is any news or
roadblocks from the holidays, and if there is a way the larger group can make
this easier.

### SCA2024

We've been invited to give a lightning talk as part of a larger educational
session at [Supercomputing Asia 2024](https://sca24.sc-asia.org/). We've
accepted, logistical details are pending. This was an outreach success, the
organizer of this session learned about us at SC23, probably through the HPC
Education Pathfinding session.

The current status: we have accepted this invitation; Andrew and Annajiat will
put together a pre-recorded presentation, due by Feb. 5, and attend remotely
for the Q&A. A description has been provided, somewhat hurriedly and without a
ton of consultation, in view of the deadline.

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. Annajiat has an on-going effort, Alan
has the February CECAM one, and there is a possibility of an LLNL workshop in
the late spring, as well as probably a NIST workshop in more or less the same
time-frame.

This is terrific news, and merits some discussion of logistics.

### Governance

Now that we are out from the holiday disruptions and have a bit of time to
think, we should probably re-engage with the governance issue. If we're going
to be in the Carpentries umbrella, we will want to ensure that our lessons
continue to abide by Carpentries guidelines, and that contributors feel
welcome. We will also want to be in a posiiton where we can track our
activities and demonstrate impact, which will require some reporting and
book-keeping, which some entity should own.

### Bioinformatics

This item is pending from earlier meetings, updates appreciated.

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US department of agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Craig Gross (he/him), Michigan State University
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jean Baptiste Fankam Fankam (he,him), Wits University, South Africa
- Jannetta Steyn, (she/her), Newcastle University, UK

### Cluster Migration

The new cluster is up, and has been for a bit, right now both clusters are
alive so it's possible to transfer files for another couple of weeks. The new
cluster is currently at **jetstream2.hpc-carpentry.org**, and steering
committee folks automatically have accounts already. The new cluster has
autoscaling, the login and management nodes are always up, and compute node are
provisioned on demand. It's all done through a private repo in the HPC
Carpentry organization on github that works through the Terraform cloud.

As a practical matter, we should "upskill" the rest of the steering committee
so that others can stand up the cluster.

Also this cluster configuration is the default for the HPC Intro lesson.

The old cluster will disappear automatically at the end of January, 2024.

### Workflow Lesson Development

There's a new release of Snakemake, version 8 has potentially-breaking changes,
but it might be OK? Also this version has native SLURM integration, so you can
run our existing Snakefiles with `--slurm` and it will work, with some
warnings.

There's an oddity, if you use snakemake from the module, it's not visible on
the nodes after dispatch, because the new user session on the node does not
have the module loaded. This is fixable with a SLURM batch file, which our
learners already know how to do.

There's a philosophical question to be resolved about how automatic we want
this to be for the learners -- there's pedagogical value in working through the
set-up process, and connecting workflow concepts to the actual process on the
cluster, but simplicity of operation is also a virtue, hiding the complexity
also reduces the learner's cognitive burden.

There are also related changes to the HPC Intro lesson, it doesn't have
sufficient (or sufficiently good) coverage of environment variables. There
might be a PR about this soon. This is covered in Shell Extras, but it's a bit
complicated HPC, because the preferred modular scheme might be different, e.g.
lmod-style modules, conda environments, spack, or EasyBuild-related things.

Q about attribution: Link to the source, make sure credit is visible. Many
projects use the default or templated license file that has stuff about this.

Also a polite thing to do is to have a top-level `license.txt` file or
something that shows where all the third-party content is and how it's
licensed.

### SCA2024

A title and description were sent to Ann Backhaus for the January 17 deadline,
which was shared in the meeting. The next deadline is Feb. 5, at which time a
recording will be submitted. At the actual conference, we will do live Q&A over
zoom after the pre-recorded talk is run.

### Workshops

We are exploring doing a workshop with LLNL, and the number of one helper for
every five to ten learners came up, which Andrew wanted to sanity-check with
the group. This seems reasonable.

We will likely have a NIST workshop in May or so.

Alan's BioNT workshop will also be re-run in the summer, so that's another one
to add to the list.

As of next week, Michigan State will be replacing their intro lesson with the
HPC Intro lesson. They understand our desire for feedback.

For surveys, it's possible to do fancy things with Github, maybe an easy way to
do feedback. See
[here](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pilot_workshop_feedback.yml)

Making the feedback channels conspicuous is useful.

### Sidebar for infrequent attendees

Jannetta had more foundational issues and has not fully engaged with the
EasyBuild process, EasyBuild can be challenging on small systems due to memory
requirements to build things. The EESSI scheme provides binaries, and is
compatible with the ARM architecture, so that might be a better option.
Jannetta says she has seen the [EESSI docs](https://www.eessi.io/docs/), and
plans to follow up.

### Governance

For measuring impact, publication and citation of lessons is a possibility.
(Consider a Zenodo release.)

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL
- Georgia Stuart, UMass Amherst

### HPC Cluster Migration

Covered in the AM.

### Workflow Lesson Development

Also covered in the AM.

### SCA2024

Covered in the AM.

### Workshops

Georgia asked about virtual vs. in-person workshops for Carpentries content.
(She has experience as a trainer of teachers.) For small groups (fewer than 10
learners), pausing for the instructor to troubleshoot an individual learner's
obstacles has worked. For larger groups, Georgia mentioned regular
breakout-room-breaks for helpers to guide learners through issues in smaller
batches and in parallel. Alternatively, the XSEDE/ACCESS-style "satellite site"
model for delocalized training makes sense.

Additional conversation led to some questions about access to the repo for
standing up the cluster. Jane and/or Georgia expressed an interest in joining
the hpc-carpentry organization on github.

### Governance

Threw the question to the visitors -- how do they steer lesson development in
directions that they want it to go, and how do they assess impact?

UMass's program is new, they don't have answers.

LLNL's program was historically dominated by a particular individual, who did
all the things. They do post-training surveys, but it's not obvious that the
lessons evolved responsively to the survey data. Keeping materialk up to date
and regularly doing lessons is the priority, things that are more like steering
and governance were not high priorities.

Things we might do with money: Could someone trained in education evaluate the
outcomes of workshops? Do smarter surveys?
