# HPCC Meeting, July 4, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

A draft formal reply to the e-mail exists in the incubation
[request repository](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request) on
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com). We should finalize this thing.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

The [RSECon24 abstract](https://codimd.carpentries.org/EmMCGrk-QreFQU1mlhG8Fw)
is on a Codi.

There is also an opportunity to submit an abstract for a 10-minute talk to the
HPC BoF at [RSEcon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), see the
[Slack message](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C04AV65FUPR/p1719223728893559)
from Andy Turner. Deadline is July 16.

### The Website

We had a co-working meeting
[May 30](https://codimd.carpentries.org/vxPFtsRXRYy5vw5Qd6W3_Q), where a bit of
progress was made in cleaning up the lesson lists on the
[main website](https://hpc-carpentry.org). There is still lots to do!

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

At this point, we have had a look at the workshop feedback, this is a good time
to review that.

### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

Following up from both [last meeting][last-meeting] and the SIGHPC Education
activity, Alan put a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their
version of the HPC Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a
solution for the snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the
presentation is a bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Marc-Andre Hermanns
- Jannetta Steyn
- Alan O'Cais
- Benson Muite
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Conferences and Outreach

Marc-Andre was present and had a near-term deadline, so we discussed the
conference situation first. Also, apparently the wrong agenda link was sent out
to the announcements, that got fixed.

For RSECon24, we probably want to make some changes to the abstract, the one
that we sent is more broadly scoped for the entire RSE community, whereas the
current opportunity is for the HPC BoF specifically, so probably it can be
shorter and we can assume some HPC knowledge.

### Carpentries Incubation

The boilerplate that's in the repo as of now is fine, but the steering
committee needs to have a conversation about how to prioritize to meet the time
scale.

Not all of the steering commitee is present at the meeting, so we might take
this up in Slack and/or e-mail.

### The Website

The site broke down earlier, but Alan was able to fix it, it's getting a bit
creaky, it relies on Ruby infrastructure that's a few years out of date.

Carpentries is redeveloping their site, we can follow their site template once
it's in place. An overhaul before that owuld probably be wasted effort.

### Workflow Lesson Development

Next step here is to look at the feedback from the LLNL workshop, which
currently is on a Markdown file on Trevor's laptop.

#### HPC Carpentry at LLNL: Feedback

Two workshops were presented, back-to-back. The following stickies were
captured in no particular order.

##### "Red Stickies" (actually lavender)

> _Room was a little chilly._

> _Since so much of the teaching compounds, people definitely struggled more on
> Day 2. Something to plan for: more 1-on-1 help probably needed._

> _When demoing, sometimes do not see what the command was._

> _Would be good if we could see more of your earlier command lines, by a share
> screen or something._

> _Maybe have a command "cheat sheet" or short overview presentation._

> _Combining commands unclear._

> _Do follow-ups between major code-line changes._

> _The pace could be a little faster, to cover more material._

> _Remember that `curl` generates an invalid file if the URL is incorrect._

> _Overall it's great! For a more public course, maybe speak louder and stay on
> track. But overall I'm learning a lot!_

> _Wonder if using Jupyter would be better? Jupyter can also do a command
> prompt, and you can write an explanation of each command next to it._

> _AC is very cold._

> _There are 2 screens: perhaps keep one displaying past commands, if some
> people still need it._

> _Would be helpful to see more of the previous commands if we fall a little
> behind._

> _More class please!_

> _Offer prior reading material (glossary, basic command list, etc.) for "true"
> novices._

> _The last example with nested parameters didn't really work. Maybe a smaller
> sample set, or a generator?_

> _Take more breaks._

> _Handouts with commands to follow along would be useful._

> _Giving a lesson handout beforehand for people to preview would be helpful._

> _There was a lot of jargon I was unfamiliar with. Maybe a bit slower
> explanations could help those with limited experience?_

> _There were quite a few times that the typing/actions just went too fast---if
> only there were a list of commands!_

> _Suggestion: change one TV to display long syntax/links/things that people
> need to copy and other TV to follow._

> _I don't think many other people did sticky notes. You should do an online
> survey each day during a break to get better data/feedback._

> _Provide an itinerary._

##### "Green Stickies" (actually teal)

> _Very helpful staff, able to handle individual troubleshooting._

> _More "negative" examples would be good---anti-patterns, etc._

> _Trevor's repetition of different topics really helps!_

> _I've been (poorly) hacking my way through the command line for YEARS now.
> Thank you guys for the proper lesson on Shell!_

> _Clever flow of the class, going from Amdahl to loops to plots. Good
> structure!_

> _Really awesome & kind instructors, learned a lot, had value._

> _I learned a **lot** and you all were so very patient with us, I really
> appreciate the extra helping hands you had. We aren't sure yet how we'll use
> it, but it seemed useful._

> _I greatly appreciated the hands-on support! Having no coding/programming
> experience before this, I was grateful for the patience!_

> _THANK YOU!_

> _HPC Carpentry is a valuable idea! We don't really have a guided "getting
> started."_

> _Really enjoyed being able to catch up via shared
> [`give`](https://github.com/hpc/give)n files._

> _Best instructors and class ever! Very nice and helpful!!_

> _Without this workshop I wouldn't be able to do HPC work._

> _Definitely is applicable to projects in my directorate._

> _The "let's try it" approach for going through the exercises was great._

> _Overall easy to follow. Scripting section at last 5 to 10 min was a little
> fast._

> _Pacing and space to ask questions is very helpful._

> _It's great to finish with our own written codes._

> _Like the pace and making sure everyone is following._

> _Explaining what each command means is great!_

> _Good examples._

> _Good walkthrough._

> _Good pace of walking through commands._

> _There are people around to call for help._

> _Learned a lot of useful commands that I did not know before._

For the cloud allocation, the credits blow up soon. Should we extend them? Ping
Mike Renfro about this, see if he has something he wants to do with them? Maybe
ping the larger HPCC group? (Benson will check in with Annajiat on this.)

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL
- Clark Gaylord (he/him), GWU

### Conferences and Outreach

Clark Gaylord reports that we missed the PEARC deadline for a presentation on
HPC Carpentry, but ACCESS Campus Champions have invited us to speak at a
meeting.

### Workflow Lesson Development

There might be an opportunity to present some of the Snakemake material at GW
(Clark Gaylord) in the fall.
