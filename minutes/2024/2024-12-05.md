# HPCC Meeting, December 5, 2024

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early],
  better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late],
  better for the Americas and Oceania
  Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Jean has been leading the charge on this. Are we at a stage where it makes
sense for others to contribute or review?

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to
the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared
document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes
about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened
was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been
created, then [migrated to the
workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic
migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the
outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in
the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want
new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do
workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

Andrew spoke about HPC Carpentry at the ["Best Practices in HPC
Education"](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/) at SC'24. How'd
it go, Andrew?

Jannetta and Marc-André spoke at [CarpentryConnect
Heidelberg](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html). How'd it go?

- [name=Alan] [name=Marc-Andre] | *Managing the HPC curriculum: from core to specialized topics*
    - Small group, good discussions
    - Finding hosting institutions
        - 2-day curriculum competes with existing course material
            - Need to check/adapt some topics?
        - Smaller institutions may be good initial target?
        - Centers usually want adaption to their local environment
            - Use case for 'snippets'?
    - Specific Instructor On-boarding needed
        - Additional knowledge of administration tasks are needed when "self-hosting" SLURM
            - Support by local admins can help at local HPC centers
- [name=Marc-André], [name=Toby], [name=Andrew] | "HPC Carpentry BoF Session" at deRSE
    - prepared and submitted, acceptance still pending

#### Large Workshops

Andrew, Trevor, and Jane hosted back-to-back workshops at [LLNL](https://hpc.llnl.gov) in June, and have been asked by training/education staff at [LBL](https://it.lbl.gov/service/scienceit/) and [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov) to host workshops for their users as well.
The current model does not scale well: HPC Carpenters' time and travel budgets are finite.
- How can we cooperate with these sites to impart HPC wisdom to hundreds of learners, without leaving the Carpentries philosophy and pedagogy entirely behind?
- Can we "flip the script" to grow our community from/with these labs, and help them build Instructor pools of their own?

### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

#### The Website

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries

### Notes

#### Workbench

#### How was SC24?

Andrew: "It was awesome!"


##### Question on "Becoming a Carpentries Instructor"

Many people asked how to become an Instructor, without being a member of an institution?
- Individuals can pay for their own training through The Carpentries, or contact a member organization for a spare seat of theirs.
    - NIST has some seats for training.
    - [UK RN](https://www.ukrn.org) has some seats as well.
    - Some public-facing institutions such as Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) have slots for people to "borrow".
    - Support for travel?
- Toby asked about our Instructor policy.
  HPC Carpentry shares The Carpentries' rulebook, that at least one Instructor must be certified by The Carpentries.
  We might soften this requirement during Incubation, to reduce friction for pilot workshops.

On Outreach: EPCC led an exercise taking an article and reducing it to a paragraph or a pitch that really grabs interest. One of Andrew's breakout group is a playwright, and guided them through the process of creating a narrative arc from chaotic source material.

Books:
- Richard H. Millington, [_Buzzing Communities_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16136186-buzzing-communities)
- Nadia Eghbal, [_Working in Public_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54140556-working-in-public), about Linux Kernel types of projects (large). There will be core maintainers, but also fly-by contributors who might submit one PR then never return. So, be careful assessing community size from contributor lists.

Digital Research Alliance of Canada _is not_ the successor to ComputeCanada. The folks Andrew spoke to were not aware of HPC Carpentry or ComputeCanada's contributions to our materials.
- DRAC is mostly a funding organization, not highly technical.
- The institutional knowledge is around there somewhere: how can we reconnect the thread?

A question from [NAIRR Pilot](https://nairrpilot.org) - is there AI Carpentry material? (No.) Should there be? (Out-of-scope for us at this time.)
HPC Carpentry is about bringing novices into the fold. An AI Carpentry would likely pursue intermediate users who need to understand the nuances of different models, methods, etc.

[Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org) came up a few times as well: the Chapel "hello, world" is parallel already, so instruction can jump directly into how parallel execution works, rather than getting into the weeds with the MPI framework.
Chapel Intro "could" be the anchor lesson for a Parallel Programming curriculum.
- Toby: Are the SWC Shell and HPC Intro lessons valuable to people who come for a programming workshop?
- Andrew: Some researchers have traversed a narrow, brittle path to get work done, and want to revisit the fundamentals for some breadth.


##### Takeaway from HPCC presentation at SC'24 (BPHTE'24 workshop)

Ref session: https://sc24.conference-program.com/session/?sess=sess752

What were our asks in SC'24 Presentation (BPHTE'24) to the community (inputs, actions):

  - Identify new learners in their respective communities

  - Discovering forks: If you have improved upon HPC Carpentry materials, please connect back to us. We want to learn about your improvements. (Same from us to you.)

  - Address the need for (or lack of) infrastructure with MagicCastle Terraform solution.

  - Reach back to people who approached us with interest in HPCC during this workshop.



#### How was CarpentryConnect?

Jannetta: it was good! Excellent keynotes, not about HPC.

miniHPC discovery: EESSI requires Internet access! This makes the _offline_ aspect more challenging.

Toby: it was the greatest event of all time. Excellent keynotes, about community.

Marc-André had a lovely poster showing the availability of HPC services in each region of Germany. 

### Large Workshops

Workshops for large institutions: it would be easy to say "yes" to these folks, but we might dissipate all our energy parachuting into various places and have nothing left for developing the curriculum. If trainings for 100+ people simultaneously is _necessary_, CodeRefinery would be a viable option. They have quality learning materials, and they have the logistics to "bring your own classroom".
We should practice talking through the HPC Carpentry philosophy for such workshops, and try persuading them to subdivide those events into Carpentries-sized workshops (20 Learners at most, per session), and whether large workshops are ever really effective.

If the NSF CyberTraining bid succeeds, somebody's time can be compensated partially to reach out to large HPC sites to learn how they operate and pitch the Carpentries approach. Meanwhile, and if the grant application does not succeed, well, we need to be doing this anyway.

_Please keep an eye out for other funding sources. Incubation will only work if we invest significant time into moving this forward -- which means getting paid for it._

### AOB

- [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) might be a funding source for a "lending library" of miniHPC clusters.

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), ODU
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute

### Notes

#### AI Carpentry

Andrew talked to Shelley Knuth [Director of ACCESS' End-User Support Services project]. The question asked by Shelley: Is there an effort already underway that they (NAIRR) can tap into? Status of AI Carpentry: Not ready (not sensible to aim for some kind of product) for April NAIRR workshop.

(Target of the AI Carpentry: to upskill researchers who are not yet doing much AI research, e.g. people at R2 universities and those with lower research expenditure.)


#### Migration of hpc-intro to the Workbench format

Jean will put something in the Slack with progress to date, and with a link to the repo, inviting feedback.

#### Large Workshops (part 2)

We want to argue that the large-learner workshop format won't work, and want to persaude the site to adopt more of the Carpentries style. Our typical workshop size is ~13-14 people.

#### NSF CyberTraining funding

Goal: Trying to get NSF funding to support somebody to steward the transition of HPC Carpentry into a full part of the Carpentries lesson program. This requires a lot of time & effort.

(There is a complication if the [co-]PI is someone from the Federal Government.) The actual lead PI will be Erin Becker, from the Carpentries.

Wirawan has done an NSF cybertraining proposal before, and knows some ins and outs of the process, the ingredients required for the success of such a proposal---he will share with Trevor and Erin Becker.



#### Reaching out to US general research computing community

Clark Gaylord (GWU): Thinking of making an HPC Carpentry presentation for ACCESS (or CASC?).

Communities available to reach out:

  - [CASC](https://casc.org/)
  - [CaRCC](https://carcc.org/)
  - [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)
  - [BSSW](https://bssw.io/)
  - [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
  - [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/)
