# HPCC Meeting, November 7, 2024

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa,
  Asia, and Europe
  - Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], better for the
  Americas and Oceania
  - Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

In keeping with [last time's discussion][last-meeting], we will open with the
broadest scope.

As a reminder, the
[full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of
[several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on
the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress
arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops,
and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture.

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which
are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The
goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable
pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there
is to do.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Jean has been leading the charge on this. Are we at a stage where it makes
sense for others to contribute or review?

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to
the Carpentries Workbench. There's a
[shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with
notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had
happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online)
had been created, then
[migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake)
using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

There was some slack traffic about the name, indicating that we should not be
too specific about the tool -- ideally it would cover workflow as a practical
benefit, and not be tied to a specific tool.

It's got a good history, it worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop in the
summer, modified for their Maestro workflow tool.

#### Quarto scheduling

There's a
[Quarto issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/carpentries-quarto/issues/43) on the
UCL site. There's interest in creating a subcommittee to explore substituting
Quarto for **{varnish}** or **R** altogether. A kick-off meeting was scheduled
for Oct. 18.
[Meeting notes](https://codimd.carpentries.org/58-AKs59SQe1UhcfQ2caXg):

- Progress made: collected context on Workbench vs Quarto
- Obstacles to progress identified: Accessibility features built into Workbench
  are baked into **{varnish}** so substituting Quarto for **{varnish}** would
  result in a loss of functionality/accessibility.
- Experimentation is needed to try this or other possible paths while
  maintaining accessibility:
  > integrating Quarto at an early stage in site rendering to continue
  > leveraging the `sandpaper`/`pegboard`/`varnish` infrastructure to preserve
  > accessibility features
- Carpentries does not have resources to support a Quarto effort.

#### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the
outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in
the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want
new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do
workshops without us?

##### Actual Conferences

Andrew attended USRSE, and will report on how that went.

Our submission for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24 was accepted.

As recorded on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), the manuscript
and slides have now been submitted, and the presenter (Andrew) is ready to go.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/),
12-14 November 2024.

##### Actual Workshops

- Marc-André Hermanns will help with a
  [normal Python course (gapminder/non-HPC) locally (at RWTH) in November](https://dkz2r.github.io/2024-11-21-python-workshop/)
- [Call for Contributions for deRSE'25 in Karlsruhe, Germany](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/abstracts/)
  is **open until Oct 28, 2024**
  - [HPC.NRW](https://hpc.dh.nrw/) (which Marc-André is a member of) is
    currently thinking about how to contribute
  - Potential for an "Intro to HPC" as Tutorial/Skill-Up?

#### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/UB
- Annajiat
- Jannetta
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Marc-André Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen, Germany
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA

### Carpentries Incubation

Salience of this issue is clear, it deserves focused attention. The formal plan
is to dedicate the next meeting (Nov. 21) to this. This is during SC, but does
not necessarily conflict, so it's do-able.

The task is as before, focus on the list of tasks and set priorities, identify
which things we are currently doing well, what things we need to put more
effort into, and assess likelihood of success.

Marc-Andre is willing to take a first cut at documenting activities on the
[Github issue](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2).

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

There has been progress, the lesson is likely close to a point where a
co-working session could be held for Jean, who has been taking the lead on
this, can walk folks through how it works and assess the feasibility of
migrating other episodes.

Preliminary idea is to get all of Intro to HPC with working snippets for the
default Magic Castle setup, and then look at modifying the snippet architecture
to accommodate multiple sites. The latter will be better-informed if the first
stage is actually complete.

### Workflow Lesson Development

There's an "optics" issue with the lesson, the specification to Snakemake might
lead to misunderstandings about the scope of the lesson. It's meant to be be a
workflow lesson that happens to use Snakemake, but a casual reader might think
it's a lesson about Snakemake. The proposal is to change the name to not be
specific, and add material to the beginning of the lesson that clears up the
intended scope.

There's already an issue.

### Quarto scheduling

The meeting notes are linked-to in the agenda above, and repeated
[here](https://codimd.carpentries.org/58-AKs59SQe1UhcfQ2caXg).

The long-term plan has apparently always been to incorporate Quarto into the
Workbench, but it was not mature enough when the trigger was pulled. Migrating
to directly Quarto would effectively overwrite the accessibility infrastructure
that was included via "varnish". Quarto is now mature enough, but there's a
strategy question about whether Quarto can perhaps be incorporated "upstream"
in a way that preserves existing varnish functionality -- this is a technical
question for which the answer is not currently known.

### Conferences and Outreach

Brief digression about the goals of outreach -- the USRSE activity raised
awareness, but subsequent engagement was minimal. The talk did not have an
"ask", maybe it should.

If we had an "ask", what would it be?

Alan and Marc-Andre have been thinking about this by way of the
CarpentriesConnect activity. One of their asks is around the question of how
good of a fit the HPC core curriculum is to existing centers. How good of a fit
are we? What changes would make us a better fit?

Also, who will adopt this? Large centers? Small centers? Large centers may
believe their training problem is solved, and they might be right about that.

Contributing: We need instructors and maintainers, are there barriers for
people to contributing to this effort?

Are there people who are willing to evangelize on our behalf?

What does onboarding look like?

(Side note: Reach out to Craig Gross and find out what barriers he encountered
-- he seemed enthusiastic after SC23, but then kind of disappeared.)

Annajiat: Long-term goal is to integrate some of this material into formal
educational material, including the hands-on piece. Requires long-term access
to a resource, and a tolerance for non-uniformity across sites, since some
learners may be moving around professionally.

#### Actual Conferences and Workshops

The deRSE activity didn't happen, but there will be future opportunities.

Q about whether deRSE can be remote? Nobody on the call is sure, but it seems
likely.

### The Website

The other Carpentries lesson program workshops are all very basic now, and
pretty much everything else is redirected to the Carpentries. Should we emulate
this? Some or all of this?

Maybe as a preliminary cut, take one of those sites and re-skin it?

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- David Palmquist

New person, David Palmquist, recently became an instructor trainer, is at Cal
State Fullerton. Campus has access to the
[Nautilus](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/nautilus/) cluster. (Not to be
confused with the
[US Navy's Nautilus](https://centers.hpc.mil/users/docs/navy/nautilusUserGuide.html)
HPC system.)

Discovery: The "About us" section of the webiste does not have a link to the
workflow lesson. Created
[PR 94](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/94) to
fix this.

Apparently the relevant Nautilus cluster is kind of Kubernetes-y, it's for
containerized big-data applications.
