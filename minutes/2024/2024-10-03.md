# HPCC Meeting, October 03, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia,
  and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_late], better for the Americas
  and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Both meetings will use Zoom. The [early][earlier] meeting will use [Carpentries
Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], and the [late][evening] meeting will use [Carpentries
Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], following the usual pattern.

## Agenda

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Work has begun in earnest on an attempt to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro]
lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a
[shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with
notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had
happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online)
had been created, then
[migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake)
using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

During the Sept. 27 meeting, a group of folks had a look at the result, and
Tony Hallam gave us a walkthrough of the EPCC scheme for doing this. It looked
like a reasonable path forward was to insert the EPCC snippets into the new
repo, and then broaden their scope to new snippets, keeping an eye on the scope
and burden on organizers, with a view to maybe re-scoping or re-working the
snippets.

We'll discuss progress made on that, and/or other ideas for a path forward.

The actual motivating issue for this effort was about adopting a candidate new
layout engine, Quarto, over the Varnish engine currently in the Carpentries
workbench. (Assuming I understand this correctly -- feedback welcome!). There's
a related [issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/carpentries-quarto/issues/43) on
the UCL site. This has not gotten as much attention.

### Other Issues

The following issues are still important, but there hasn't been a lot of
movement on them, in some cases because the relevant conferences haven't
happened yet.

#### Conferences and Outreach

##### Conferences

Our submission for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24 was accepted.

As recorded on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), the manuscript
and slides have now been submitted, and the presenter (Andrew) is ready to go.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/),
12-14 November 2024.

##### Workshops

- Marc-André Hermanns will help with a
  [normal Python course (gapminder/non-HPC) locally (at RWTH) in November](https://dkz2r.github.io/2024-11-21-python-workshop/)
- [Call for Contributions for deRSE'25 in Karlsruhe, Germany](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/abstracts/)
  is **open until Oct 28, 2024**
  - [HPC.NRW](https://hpc.dh.nrw/) (which Marc-André is a member of) is
    currently thinking about how to contribute
  - Potential for an "Intro to HPC" as Tutorial/Skill-Up?

#### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

#### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

I think there are no urgent issues here that aren't covered elsewhere, but this
is a slot for anything I have forgotten.

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle University
- Clark Gaylord, George Washington University
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito
- Dimitrios Theodorakis (he/him), Met Office

### Intro Lesson Development

Jean Chang had sort of taken the lead on the snippet migration to the workbench
migrated lesson. First step is to just set up a text transfer and get it
started.
[More info](https://carpentries.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T/p1727956092711159)
posted to Slack post-meeting.

There was a brief discussion of why the migrated lesson has Rmd files and not
md. The reason for this is that there's R code that gets rendered into the
displayed page. It's not related to the site being on a system that has access
to the cluster, which was a point of confusion during some of the discussion.

Quarto: may be more a replacement for **R**, not just **{varnish}**. Dimitri
has made good progress porting a lesson to Quarto; multi-language sites will be
much easier (i18n).

Dmitri is planning to meet with a UCL person who has done some work with
Quarto, and Joel, who has done some work with the Japanese ports of the lesson
material, and whoever else wants to come.

### Conferences

Recap of upcoming events -- CarpentriesConnect, SC24, USRSE are all coming up.

For CarpentriesConnect, Jannetta is looking for help with her activities, which
are the miniHPC and adapting lesson material for the Carpentries Offline
lesson. The Quarto activity is of interest here. Preparation activities can be
asynchronous, but also some help will be needed at the workshop itself.

### Workshops

For the deRSE call, HPC is in the list of topics, so this is maybe something we
should look into.

- George Washington University holding a "Carpentries-like" HPC workshop 15
  October

This group has been encouraged to use our material if possible, and contribute
back if possible, and they might use the Amdahl tool.

### The Website

Brief discusion of which mailing list we want to advertise as primary. Andrew
shared his model wher ethe discuss-hpc list is the low-barrier public one, and
maintainers-hpc is more narrowly scoped. Nobody objected to this model, the
site should be changed to reflect this.

### Workflow

Now in the Incubator:
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/HPC-workflow-lesson-maestro

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Jean screen-shared progress on the lesson, the upshot is dropping in an EPCC
Rmd file, along with the snippet source and config files, and then rendering
the lesson, works, in the sense that you get a rendered extra page with content
substituted from the snippets.

Additional discussion on the appropriate architecture -- default plus overlay,
or something, with the default being the Magic Castle set-up.
