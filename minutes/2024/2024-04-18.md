# HPCC Meeting, Apr. 18, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### eSciences Collaboration (Tentative)

We've had some e-mail conversations with Mateusz Kuzak, and then Sven van der
Burg, both from the
[Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), about
incorporating some of the excellent work they have done in their traning
program into our workshops. There's a
[gpu lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lesson-gpu-programming/)
and a
[parallel python lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lesson-parallel-python/).

As of this writing, it's not clear if they will be able to attend, but if they
can do so, the topic will be the areas of overlap and opportunities for
collaboration. The lessons seem to be development-focused, which is an area
that has not gotten a ton of attention from us, so this is timely and
interesting.

### Conferences and Outreach

Both
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/) and
[RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) conferences have near-term
deadlines.

The CarpentryConnect abstract ~~is coming together
[here](https://codimd.carpentries.org/E5xcpa4qRmWHHtRhUwt7Zg). The deadline is
April 19.~~ was submitted by Alan O'Cais.

The RSECon24 abstract is
[here](https://codimd.carpentries.org/EmMCGrk-QreFQU1mlhG8Fw) and is somewhat
less developed. The deadline is May 1.

### The Website

Our main [website](https://hpc-carpentry.org) has gotten a bit stale over the
past while. This agenda item is motivated in part by some work that Alan O'Cais
already did getting the workshop list updated, but also it has come up at
various times in recent meetings.

The proposed task is to check in on progress on issues identified earlier, and
possibly identify new ones.

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught once! And there's a
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) on
it! It's currently in "draft" status pending a resolution of some attribution
issues. There was a plan for this at the [last meeting][last-meeting], has this
been executed? What are the other barriers to merging, and can we capture them
in the PR?

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. There are plans to do a workshop at
LLNL the week of June 30, and probably a NIST workshop a week or two later.

Still not done, these workshops have not been submitted to the workshop form on
the website.

### Speaking Invitation

Scott Callaghan from the [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/)
chapter of the ACM has invited Andrew to give a talk about HPC Carpentry as
part of their speaker series. Andrew has connected with Weronikia Fillinger and
is working on sketching out a talk.

---

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle University
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), Old Dominion university
- Annajiat Alim Rasel, Brac University

### eScience

We heard back from this group, they are not able to attend today, we'll
schedule a call with them soon.

### Conferences/Outreach

For CarpentryConnect, the request for a breakout session has been submitted,
the text in the [Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/E5xcpa4qRmWHHtRhUwt7Zg)
is what was sent.

Jannetta is finalizing the MiniHPC/HPC-Carpentry tutorial. There was a
technical issue with the cluster interacting badly with the EESSI
infrastructure, which was resolved in a timely manner, so it seems there are no
technical obstacles.

Jannetta also wants to submit the same MiniHPC tutorial for RSEcon and
CarpentryConnect. Consensus is that this is a good idea.

Andrew is working on the RSEcon24 proposal, it's also in draft form on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/EmMCGrk-QreFQU1mlhG8Fw). It's currently
not in a submittable state, the abstract is too long, and none of the other
fields are filled in. Deadline is May 1.

Q: Is this proposal in scope? One of the activities RSEs are doing is
education, and HPC Carpentry focus area (HPC education) seems to fall in line.

Marc-Andre has connected with Jane Herriman about participating in the "sofa
talk" at ISC24, that looks like it's coming together. Nominal topic is
certification, which is useful to us as a scoping tool, even if we ourselves
can't offer certificates.

Idea: There are a number of outreach efforts that are pending, with varying
priorities, and various pending lesson ideas, it would be useful to catalog
these on the website. Clarity about our degree of engagement would be important
here.

### Website

Craig has created some issues on the site, and maybe prepared a PR, we should
check it and see.

- [#79 - Clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
- [#78 - Clarify maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)

We should also add the upcoming workshops on the site, to exercise the tool, if
nothing else.

### Discussion of workshop delivery mode

Online? In-person? Hybrid? Upon seeing
https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/past-workshops/, there are quite a number of
workshops Comments by Marc-Andre:

- In-person only: Concern: hesitation from many people in attending; so the
  total attendance would be lower than what expected.
- Online-only: Very easy logistically, but the outcome engagement is generally
  low.
- Hybrid was the worst mode

Additional workshops may exist (they do!) but not registered to this.

### Workflow lesson development

Recent traffic consisted of the addition of a citation file to the PR, this is
currently under review.

Question on whether it's feasible to replace Snakemake with
[Maestro](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/maestro-workflow-conductor)
(LLNL-developed workflow manager). This should not be a problem since what we
want to deliver is the ins-and-outs of the workflow

### Workshops

Upcoming: LLNL, NIST.

LLNL workshop: Facing a little bit of snag in getting the travel cost
reimbursed, due to lab regulations prohibiting the intended cost-coverage. This
may not be insurmountable, perhaps using travel money from the instructor's
institution.

There was a workshop request from NERSC (request coming from Lipi Gupta).
Timeframe: Early June, coinciding with the LLNL workshop. If they have
instructors who are familiar with the Carpentries way of teaching, they should
be able to pull it off using local instructors.

### SIGHPCeducation speaking invitation

Weronica Filinger identified an EPCC colleague who is willing to co-present.
Timeframe is still TBD, either late May or early June.

### New Business

Marc-Andre is about to go through instructor training. It's four half-days,
generally on-line, and there are some follow-up activities.

There's a nominal requirement to stay active and maintain your status by doing
some teaching with some frequency, but the Carpentires are very accommodating,
if you're active in the community in other ways, that also counts.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman, LLNL
- Diego Menendez, Penn State

### Introductions

Diego is an RSE at Penn State's Institute for Computational & Data Sciences.
He's been on the mailing list for a few years, and is joining the community
call for the first time.

### Review Earlier Meeting

- eSciences: unable to attend today, Andrew will follow up off-line.
- RSEcon (Albuquerque): Diego is helping with one of the committees.
- RSEcon (Newcastle): Jannetta is submitting MiniHPC.
- [Big PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) on
  hpc-workflows is ready for review.

### Workshops

Both LLNL annd NIST workshops need to go on the Upcoming Workshops form.

#### Maestro Workflows

Jane & colleagues are looking at the Workflows lesson and contemplating how to
do it using
[Maestro](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/maestro-workflow-conductor)
rather than Snakemake.

Q: Does Maestro have a 1-to-1 mapping of concepts?

A: Not really. Running Maestro involves a named YAML file, which creates an
output directory with date & timestamp. So, repeat runs create new directories
rather than skipping completed tasks. Some restructuring of the lesson is
required; Jane is working on it.

Maestro lets you write a _parameter_ (separate from the environment variables)
where you can provide a list of variable values, which job steps can iterate
over. (Snakemake also does this; it may not be identical, but the functionality
is present. Requires explaining lambda functions in Snakemake, but not in
Maestro.) Snakemake rules don't run at _load time_, only at _runtime_.

- Site: https://xorjane.github.io/maestro-workflow-lesson/

#### LLNL Workshop

Jane has volunteer helpers lined up. Only need one, but for four consecutive
days, having spare helpers is good.

Trevor needs to get on the ball.

Andrew needs to send LLNL all the PII that OPM leaked a few years ago already.

Both need to complete paperwork to get LLNL accounts, so collaborative porting
from Snakemake to maestro can really get going.

#### NIST Workshop

Later in June.
