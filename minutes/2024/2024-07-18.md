# HPCC Meeting, July 18, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

An affirmative reply has been sent to the Carpentries folks, but we still have
concerns and maybe questions about the timeline and so forth.

A draft formal reply to the e-mail exists in the incubation
[request repository](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request) on
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com). At this point it is not entirely clear if the
formal reply is still relevant, but it can still serve as a nucleus for
discussion.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

An abstract has been submitted to the HPC BoF at
[RSEcon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), see the
[Slack message](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C04AV65FUPR/p1719223728893559)
from Andy Turner.

The submitted text can be found on the
[shared Codi document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/jVqstrnNQXCjH8cjMFChsA),
scroll down to "as-submitted" to see what was done.

In the late session on July 4, Clark Gaylord from GWU was on, he had intended
to try to submit something for PEARC, likely based on the SCA2024 lightning
talk, but was not able to meet the deadline. He's still planning to go to
PEARC, and will try to spread the word. There may be an opportunity to speak to
the US ACCESS Campus Champion group, also.

#### Workshops

The NIST workshop was held on July 12. Due to schedule constraints, we were
only able to do HPC Intro, not the workflow lesson. We ran out of time to
complete the material, due in part to set-up time consumed by setting up SSH
access to the NIST cluster, and in part due to many learners not having much
facility with the shell. We had required completion of the Shell Intro lesson
from the earlier NIST Carpentries sessions, but not all learners met this
requirement, and some of those who did nevertheless still had issues with shell
operations.

### The Website

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting][last-meeting] was that
the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Older issues

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

Following up from both last meeting and the SIGHPC Education activity, Alan put
a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of the HPC
Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for the
snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is a
bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Marc-André Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Dimitrios Theodorakis (he/him), Met Office
- Annajiat Alim Rasel (he/him), Brac University
- Isaac Béas, Botswana ITRI

### Carpentries Incubation

Sidebar after introducting the issues, Toby says the Carpentries now thinks
they have a solution for pre- and post-workshop surveys, which are
modifications of the existing ones for other lesson programs, something we can
clone and use to track our efforts.

There's a draft blog post in the reply from Toby, the steering commitee should
engage with that.

Alan commits to writing something based on that. Trevor is on board also.
Andrew would like to be looped in also. There's a
[codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/CiF_GsWGTkKwG-TzMuFh-A?edit) to hack on
the blog post.

Question of the day: What's our comfort level with the overall set of
requirements? Is there anything in there that we can't or won't do, or anything
that we're going to do that's not in the list, for which we won't get credit?

### Conferences and Outreach

We are indeed on for CarpentriesConnect. We've submitted to the HPC BoF for
RSEcon24, trying to punch up the bridge-building aspect of linking research
use-cases to high-performance computational resources.

An abstract has been submitted to USRSE.

There might be an opportunity to talk to the ACCESS Campus Champions. Question:
Is there a list of campus champions that's somewhere publically availble? This
might help make connections, probably there is someone in the Carpentries who
is already doing this. Maybe also look into CASC -- is Wirawan a member?

The list of Campus Champions is
[here](https://campuschampions.cyberinfrastructure.org/champions/current-campus-champions).
Wirawan is on that list!

### Workshops

NIST workshop at fairly short notice. Only had time for HPC Intro. Went well,
but some challenges. First 40 mins spent (generating and) adding SSH keys to
cluster. NIST had shell+Git+Python workshop a few weeks before. Sent out
announcement stating prerequisite of shell-intro, but a lot of folks needed
time to get familiar with shell basics, slowing progress. Did not get to
Snakemake lesson, which was sort of the intended point so that was a little
frustrating. Organised a follow-up and got some feedback that this was helpful.
One learner shared that they were there to specifically learn how to batch
submit python tasks, got a very effusive thank you from them. So a couple of
wins but not all we were hoping for.

With respect to on-boarding, it's possible to streamline the process in the
lesson if accounts can be created in advance, and you can separately workshop
just connecting to the cluster. (Sidebar from Marc-André).

Toby: Folks being unfamiliar with the shell and the slowness of the connection
process are related. This could be called out in some instructor nodes in the
material, to punch up the importance of it, and list solutions such as the
separate session. Toby will capture this in an issue.

Alan: SSH is part of the lesson, so asking students to understand it ahead of
the workshop isn't right. ... instructors may need some level of skills to
recognise and resolve these types of situations.

Trevor: Working ahead doesn't actually save any time, the learners who are
successful ahead of time will also succeed in the workshop, the leaners who
have friction will have it in the worksohp anyways, so there's no time-saving
to be realized.

Marc-André: Concurs that SSH is part of the lesson, maybe not do it in advance.
With respect to people's existing resources, e.g. laptops or other resources,
the variety of environments affects what the helpers need to be able to do.
This is related to skills that instructors or helpers need to bring to the
table for HPC workshops, that maybe don't occur in non-HPC Carpentries
workshop.

### Other issues

The ACCESS allocation expires July 23. Alan has transferred the credits to
Jetstream2, and wants to extend the allocation, and is willing to write up the
extension request. We have some wins from this, exercising the MagicCastle flow
is a win.

- Jetstream2 has a MagicCastle button, so spinning up a cluster there is even
  easier than most places!

### The Website

Andrew will draft a set of criteria or a design for the website. Do the LLNL
blog post, cross-post the Carpentries one when it's up.

### Workshop Mechanics

Documenting the mechanics of setting up a workshop, e.g. pre-workshop surveys,
post-workshop surveys, standing up the workshop site and so forth. Toby can
provide template materials that might help? (No promises, but feels like a good
idea that's in-scope for his role.)

Technical follow-up: We published the wrong survey link, where did our survey
data go? The Ether?

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL

### Carpentries Incubation

Recap of the earlier session, action items are to review the blog post and the
actual requirements, and decide which things are easy or hard, and start moving
towards actually doing the thing.

### Conferences and Outreach

Also recap of the morning session. Some discussion of ACCESS and CASC, the
Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation.

### The Website

We should cross-post the Carpentries blog post, and also get the LLNL blog post
out the door, in addition to the planning/design exercise discussed in the
earlier session.
