# HPCC Meeting, October 17, 2024

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for
  Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], better for the
  Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Work has begun in earnest on an attempt to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro]
lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a
[shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with
notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had
happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online)
had been created, then
[migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake)
using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

Jean move the EPCC snippets into the "probable-pancake" fork that Toby ported
to the Workbench, the RMarkdown version of episode 12 from EPCC was added to
the forked repo and they seem to work fine. Tony suggested a couple of
alternatives to hard-coding if-else blocks in the Rmd files. These would use
top-level config flags to specify scheduler and some other details, then in the
Rmd, have something like

```R
{r load_config, include=FALSE}
library(yaml)
config <- yaml.load_file("lesson_config.yaml")
snippets_scheduler <- paste('files/snippets/', config$scheduler, sep='')
```

### Quarto scheduling

There's a
[Quarto issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/carpentries-quarto/issues/43) on the
UCL site. There's interest in creating a subcommittee to explore substituting
Quarto for **{varnish}** or **R** altogether, kick-off meeting scheduled for
Oct 18th 11:30 - 12:30 pm London Time. Meeting info shared in
[#general](https://carpentries.slack.com/archives/C03LE48AY/p1728381533747379)
[[MSFTeams meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=ee292d86-b175-446b-be6b-8769e25d37ae&tenantId=17f18161-20d7-4746-87fd-50fe3e3b6619&threadId=19_meeting_ZTQzMzhhNzUtMGFlNS00ZDg3LTkxZjgtZmFmNTNlNDczYzY1@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US)]

### Other Issues

The following issues are still important, but there hasn't been a lot of
movement on them, in some cases because the relevant conferences haven't
happened yet.

#### Conferences and Outreach

##### Conferences

Andrew is attending US-RSE.

Our submission for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24 was accepted.

As recorded on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), the manuscript
and slides have now been submitted, and the presenter (Andrew) is ready to go.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/),
12-14 November 2024.

##### Workshops

- Marc-André Hermanns will help with a
  [normal Python course (gapminder/non-HPC) locally (at RWTH) in November](https://dkz2r.github.io/2024-11-21-python-workshop/)
- [Call for Contributions for deRSE'25 in Karlsruhe, Germany](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/abstracts/)
  is **open until Oct 28, 2024**
  - [HPC.NRW](https://hpc.dh.nrw/) (which Marc-André is a member of) is
    currently thinking about how to contribute
  - Potential for an "Intro to HPC" as Tutorial/Skill-Up?

#### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

#### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

I think there are no urgent issues here that aren't covered elsewhere, but this
is a slot for anything I have forgotten.

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her), Newcastle University
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/University of Barcelona
- Marc-André Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University
- Carol Booth (she/her), Newcastle University

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Migration of "flattened" version of lesson worked just fine. Tried to do
injection of EPCC episode, but had diverged significantly. Scheduler episode
has less divergance so have gone with that for the trial.

- All or nothing as the syntax change is large
  - Transitioning from Markdown to Rmarkdown is time-consuming
  - May be able to semi-automate this
- Will document this process in the end to show what you need to look out for

### Quarto scheduling

General meeting setup for Quarto tomorrow. Link in agenda (and on Slack).

##### Conferences

Andrew at US-RSE.

[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/),
12-14 November 2024 is getting close. Alan and Marc-Andre need to set up a
meeting to discuss the content of our session. Some others from the group will
be there as well.

- Jannetta will also be there, and could do with some help for her sessions for
  Offline Carpentries.

##### Workshops

- Marc-Andre looking into giving a course at DeRSE in March next year (requires
  an application for a Skill-Up at deRSE)

  - May need some help...
  - Offers?
  - May be worth trying to contact Peter Steinbach
  - Haven't given the lesson himself yet
  - [Call for Contributions for deRSE'25 in Karlsruhe, Germany](https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/abstracts/)
    is **open until Oct 28, 2024**
  - Can potentially provide "HPC" resources for this via ACCESS but we need to
    extend the current project

- Online delivery in December 4-5
  - https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/an-introduction-to-high-performance-computing-1365
  - Maybe Marc-Andre can contribute as instructor/helper. Can follow up
    seperately.
- EPCC is running HPC Intro at Newcastle, 18-19 November (in person)
  - https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/241118-hpc-carpentry/

#### The Website

Couple of minor PRs but major issues are still outstanding

#### Carpentries Incubation

The clock is ticking! The
[full set of requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)

There's a number of open issues related to this under the coordination
repository (they have the "incubation" tag

- https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2
- For the lesson program we need to sort out short and longer-term governance
  models
- Getting lessons into the Workbench is also part of this

These are larger, somewhat philosophical questions: easy to ignore in favor of
development. --> We need to break these down into more manageable pieces, and
sort out how much we already have in place, and when it's most useful to
address. Example: governance questions can be held for the end of the
Incubation process. Identifying 6-7 Maintainers (to avoid unnecessary overlap)
is a near-term requirement.

We should set aside a co-working session to focus on the issues that Toby
opened and start organising ourselves to tackle them. We need a timeline for
things, in particular the things that are going to take longer to realise. We
need to break the issues down into sub-issues and their required timing.

If agenda items for these meetings are not aligned with the Lesson Program
Incubation, we need to think harder about our priorities. (We believe the
agenda items _are_ aligned, but thinking through that is useful.)

There is a timeline here. If we're not "ready" by the deadline, extensions are
possible, especially if we're demonstrating progress toward the finish line.
It's also in everyone's interest to not kick cans too far down the road.

It is challenging that sites that use HPC Carpentry material are not present
for these meetings: we can't force participation, but we could do better asking
people/institutions to work with us.

Alan remarked on significant interest from euroHPC, which is funding training
and related work.

- A workshop on the
  [The HPC Training Ecosystem in Europe](https://enccs.se/events/the-hpc-training-ecosystem-in-europe/)
  will be held next week (Oct 22, 14:15 – 17:15 CEST). HPC Carpentry wlil be
  presented, as well as many other projects and initiatives related to HPC
  education.

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute
- Jane Herriman

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Jean made a fork of
[Toby's probable-pancake repo](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake),
a "flattened" version of the HPC intro lesson.

- [Scheduler episode, "flattened" version](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-scheduler.html)
  in forked repo
- [EPCC version of scheduler episode](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-scheduler.html)
  in forked repo
- In-progress, manual transition of "flattened" version of scheduler episode to
  [use HPCC snippets](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html),
  also in forked repo

Flattened version (probable-pancake): tags like `{{ site.remote.prompt }}` are
rendered as-is in the output.

EPCC version: config in **episodes/**, snips converted to `Rmd`.

Jean's version: copied over HPCC MagicCastle snippets, working through
conversion from snips to md. Config at **episodes/lesson_config.yaml**.
References **epcc_config.yaml** as the default, then overwrites values.

**_TODO:_** Finish converting the scheduler episode as proof-of-concept, for
reference. Other episodes can then be converted.

**_Next:_** Port a PBS/Torque or GridEngine snippet library, and make some
structural decisions about _whether_ to keep snippets, now that we know _how_.

With the individual config files, could we build site-specific versions, rather
than requiring workshop organizers to build their own? _e.g.,_
hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-intro-epcc, hpc-intro-hpcc, etc.

Building new "snippets": because top-level config "variables" are known, the
host can be pointed to a github issue template that their local sysadmin can
populate with the necessary information to auto-generate a custom site for
their workshop.

This style of customization could propagate up to The Carpentries, e.g. for
different platforms where keyboard shortcuts differ.

### Lesson Program Incubation

Added an item to the Project Board to reach out to fork maintainers to invite
them back to the table.

For example, there are several institutions with their own active forks of the
hpc intro:

https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/forks?include=active&page=1&period=1y&sort_by=stargazer_counts

Institutions include NYU, MSU, NeSI, Boise State, UCL and Stanford.

Plan: wait until we have a "blessed" version of the website (once we're fully
on Workbench with working snippets) and then we can reach out to these groups
with an invitation to look at our shiny new website and hopefully start
contributing back. (If they seem interested, hopefully we can pull them into
one of the HPCC regular meetings to discuss ways in which their forks have
evolved and how we might be able to support them coming back (and if not, maybe
they have updates we can take.))
