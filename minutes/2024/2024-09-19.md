# HPCC Meeting, September 19, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia,
  and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_late], better for the Americas
  and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Both meetings will use Zoom. The [early][earlier] meeting will use [Carpentries
Zoom Room 2]zoom_early}, and the [late][evening] meeting will use [Carpentries
Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], following the usual pattern.

## Agenda

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

There has been some (welcome!)
[traffic](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/448) on the
[HPC Intro][hpc-intro] repository about migrating the lesson to the Carpentries
Workbench.

This is a long-standing issue, but also has complicated interactions with our
snippets scheme, which, combined with everyone's bandwidth issues, has been a
barrier.

The immediate issue is whether to adopt a candidate new layout engine, Quarto,
over the Varnish engine currently in the Carpentries workbench. (Assuming I
understand this correctly -- feedback welcome!). There's a related
[issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/carpentries-quarto/issues/43) on the UCL
site.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

Our submission for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24 was accepted.

As recorded on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), the manuscript
and slides have now been submitted, and the presenter (Andrew) is ready to go.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/).

#### Workshops

None pending (?).

### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

Additional item: Which mailing list(s) do we want to advertise? The
`maintainers-hpc` is invitation-only, but `discuss-hpc` is open, and Andrew
thinks the latter is the one for general discussion, and the former is more for
internal project communications, but in practice this distinction has not been
clear.

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

I think there are no urgent issues here that aren't covered elsewhere, but this
is a slot for anything I have forgotten.

### Older issues

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

[**_Quarto_**](https://quarto.org) is a tool that might help with our Snippet
problem in migrating the HPC Intro lesson to the workbech. Dimitri has been
looking at using Quarto in the Workbench, UCL ARC is in the lead on this.

Quarto is a document-building engine, can transform your Rmd/markdown to
documents in various forms, e.g. website, slides.

Quarto could help us leave unfilfilled file references in the lesson;
individuals/devs/instructors could create the missing files with whatever
content they like. This may simplify maintenance, as the local files wouldn't
ever be clobbered by the upstream source.

Q: What level of adoption of Quarto can we expect across the Carpentries? It's
potentially bad if we're "weird", unsynced with the rest of the Carpentries
world.

A (Toby): There is appetite but not necessarily resources. There is interest in
the curriculum development community. "Quarto is the future," as a Workbench
_replacement_. It's apparently a fairly heavy lift. (This could mean HPC
Carpentry can pilot something.)

Tony Hallam: Things to consider about this include, a lot of core Carpentries
lesson are actually fairly basic, and can be adapted to the local environment
in real time during the actual lesson session, it's not necessary to modify the
lesson content to meet this need. HPC Carpentry is different, and maybe
special. The Archer2 lesson has snippets working, in a hack-ish kind of way
that requires a new version of the lesson for variants.

Me: Snippets are less critical than some people think.

Dimitri: Quarto could possibly also do language localization in addition to
site localization. A team effort could mitigate the heaviness of the lift.
Lesson development in the presenece of Quarto/snippets would not necessarily be
different, only extension/snippet authors would be impacted. A strategic
approach to development helps, can anticipate corner cases.

Alan: Has looked at translations, but existing solutions are not integrated.

Trevor: Real-time substitutions by instructors isn't free, instructor cognitive
load is a factor, which argues in favor of "high-resolution" snippets. OTOH,
maintenance of snippet libraries is also not free. Snippet maintainers have the
knowledge of specific systems, but as HPC Carpentry scales, instructors will
come from a wider community and may not have site familiarity.

Versioning of built lessons would be of interest. The Workbench doesn't offer
this, but Quarto might.

Dimitri: The parts, and what UCL has already done:

- Top-level `_config.yaml` variables are also supported by Quarto (syntax may
  change).
- {sandpaper}: parses Markdown/Rmarkdown. Contains a Lua filter, which converts
  custom call-outs (spoilers, challenges, solutions). Easy to migrate into
  Quarto.
- {packagedown}: inscrutable magic
- {varnish}: all the styling, HTML templates (should be portable to Quarto)

Jean: Oppportunity to do a pilot on Quarto? Most of the cognitive-load reducers
could be done in Quarto variables, and snippets could be used for local
specific information? Variables for recurring things that are simple, and
snippets for localization.

Quarto has nifty visibility syntax for "profiles":

```Rmd
::: {.content-visible unless-profile="advanced"}
This content will appear in all versions save for advanced.
:::
```

This is better than snippets, as the context and customization are both in the
same place.

Next steps:

- Andrew: Incremental, move the lesson to an EPCC-like workbench set-up, then
  do Quarto?
- Alan: Work on an individual module and take it all the way to Quarto, to get
  a global picture of the solution and take advantage of the Quarto features
  sooner.

**Carpentries had someone on the workbench at a high level of effort for 3.5
years, so we should not underestimate the lift on this and/or Quarto.** We also
have the
[Incubation project](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2)
going on.

Jean: Our value to the community is to map a path from workbench to Quarto, and
also checkpointing our lesson at workbench would be good.

Alan: Shortcut, just do the SLURM version of the lesson?

Workbench porting team: Jean, me, Tony, Toby, Trevor, Mike, Annajiat. Benson
possibly off-line.

Quarto team: Jean, Dimitri, Trevor, Annajiat, Alan (but he's bandwidth
contrained).

Quarto repo? An extension to Workbench. (Dimitri's suggestion)

## 17:00 EDT Session([VTC][zoom_late])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor keller (they/them), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL
- Wirawan Purwanto, Old Dominion University
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute, Boston, MA

### HPC Intro Development

For Workbench testing, here is a snippets-free HPC Intro for our
cloud/MagicCastle instance only: https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online

The theory of this is to take an incremental approach to migration to the
workbench.

1. Fork the lesson.
2. Flatten the snippets to a static version (the repo above is this)
3. Turn the migration tool loose on it
4. Assess the results
5. Add site-localization technology to the result
6. Make a giant PR and pull it back to the main repo?
7. Enjoy the Glorious Future

Reviewed this morning's discussion, and in particular the working groups that
have spawned off of that.

### Website

Based on prior discussions, including in the early session, the `discuss-hpc`
mailing list is the one we should list as a contact e-mail, and
`maintainers-hpc` should be reserved for more private discussions.

### Carpentries Incubation

The set of tasks are organized into a
[project](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) (may
require hpc-carpentry project membership to view). A good first step is to try
to translate these into smaller achievable steps.

Given upcoming conferences, another thing to think about is what engagement
activities we will ask the community to do. Self-identifying as a potential HPC
Carpentry instructor is one possibilty. Jane Herriman put up a draft
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3m8LZ5lwf1CewP_6dmJkAUnoUG2IS_bAyA5YKehf2QfM4Ag/viewform)
that asks this question.
