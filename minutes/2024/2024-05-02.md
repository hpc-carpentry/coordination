# HPCC Meeting: May 2, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### eSciences Collaboration (Now scheduled for May 15)

We've had some
[e-mail conversations](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers-hpc/T07c52125f2581ef3/would-you-consider-including-parallel-programming-and-gpu-programming-lessons-in-the-hpc-carpentry)
with Mateusz Kuzak, and then Sven van der Burg, both from the
[Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), about
incorporating some of the excellent work they have done in their traning
program into our workshops. There's a
[gpu lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lesson-gpu-programming/)
and a
[parallel python lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lesson-parallel-python/).

As of this writing, it's not clear if they will be able to attend, but if they
can do so, the topic will be the areas of overlap and opportunities for
collaboration. The lessons seem to be development-focused, which is an area
that has not gotten a ton of attention from us, so this is timely and
interesting.

### Conferences

Both
[CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-cchd24/) and
[RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) conferences have near-term
deadlines.

The RSECon24 abstract is
[here](https://codimd.carpentries.org/EmMCGrk-QreFQU1mlhG8Fw) and is almost
ready to go. The deadline is ~~May1~~ extended to May 8.

PEARC24, Providence RI, July 21-25 https://pearc.acm.org/pearc24/

### The Website

Our main [website](https://hpc-carpentry.org) has gotten a bit stale over the
past while. This agenda item is motivated in part by some work that Alan O'Cais
already did getting the workshop list updated, but also it has come up at
various times in recent meetings.

Craig has created some issues on the site, and maybe prepared a PR, we should
check it and see.

- [#79 - Clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
- [#78 - Clarify maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)

We should also add the upcoming workshops on the site, to exercise the tool, if
nothing else.

### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught once! And there's a
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) on
it! It's currently in "draft" status pending a resolution of some attribution
issues. There was a plan for this at the [last meeting][last-meeting], has this
been executed? What are the other barriers to merging, and can we capture them
in the PR?

### Workshops

There are a few workshops in the offing. There are plans to do a workshop at
LLNL the week of June 30, and probably a NIST workshop a week or two later.
Trevor and Andrew are on the hook for both, as in-person Instructors and
Helpers.

Jane has a [Maestro fork](https://github.com/xorJane/maestro-workflow-lesson)
of the Workflow lesson for LLNL. Contributions and reviews are welcome! From
[last meeting][last-meeting]:

> Running Maestro involves a named YAML file, which creates an output directory
> with date & timestamp. So, repeat runs create new directories rather than
> skipping completed tasks. Some restructuring of the lesson is required; Jane
> is working on it.
>
> Maestro lets you write a _parameter_ (separate from the environment
> variables) where you can provide a list of variable values, which job steps
> can iterate over. (Snakemake also does this; it may not be identical, but the
> functionality is present. Requires explaining lambda functions in Snakemake,
> but not in Maestro.) Snakemake rules don't run at _load time_, only at
> _runtime_.

NIST-internal discussions of the annual summertime Carpentries workshop are
underway. Do we have a date yet? If so, time to add it to the list of workshops
on the Website.

### Speaking Invitation

Scott Callaghan from the [SIGHPC Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/)
chapter of the ACM has invited Andrew to give a talk about HPC Carpentry as
part of their speaker series. Andrew has connected with Weronikia Fillinger and
is working on sketching out a talk.

---

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Adam Tuft (he/him), Durham U.
- Annajiat Alim Rasel, Brac University

### ESciences

Scheduled for May 15, the invitation has been shared with the steering
committee, people can drop by and we'll see about areas of mutual interest and
overlap.

### Conferences

Latest state is that the CarpentryConnect abstract was submitted last time
around.

We had a real-time review of the RSEcon24 abstract, got some excellent
feedback, including noting that users are "not empowered" to use the systems,
as opposed to "lacking the skills". Also checked the "security" box, since we
do talk about access control. Much excellent wordsmithing on the abstract.

Adam T. will DM his ORCID and other info so we can credit him for his
contributions today.

### The Website

No recent action. TODO for anyone/everyone to review these.

Picked on Adam T. to use is fresh pair of eyes and interest in the project to
have a run through the site and ID issues.

### Workflow lesson development

Giant PR is still not merged, mostly a bandwidth issue. TK says he can maybe do
it today (May 2), might happen in the 2nd session.

### Workshops

LLNL is coming up, there's a NERSC opportunity, plus NIST.

### Speaking Invitation

Follow-up with co-speakers is pending.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them),NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST

### No Notes
