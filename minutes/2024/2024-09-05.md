# HPCC Meeting, September 5, 2024

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds meetings on the first and third Thursday
of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for
our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful
coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a
space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia,
  and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom][zoom_early], better for the Americas
  and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Both meetings will use Zoom. This event, Sept. 5 only, we use the same link for
both meetings, [Carpentries Zoom Room 2][zoom_early].

## Agenda

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Conferences

Our submission for the
["Best Practices in HPC Education" activity](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/)
at SC24 was accepted.

We have until Sept. 9 to respond to the feedback from the SC24 reviewers, and
Sept. 16 for a final presentation. This is a tight deadline, and this should be
in pretty good shape by the time of the meeting.

The as-submitted abstract is on the
[CodiMD](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), and the paper
is on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/66ba1c90a58bd341df753b2f).

Feedback is also on the
[Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/V7D3HZiERWCDpxFry7yxsA), or will be very
soon.

We are on for
[CarpentryConnect](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#programme).
The [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) abstract was rejected, but
has been submitted to [USRSE](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) also, for a
12-minute talk.

The abstract has been submitted to the HPC BoF at
[RSEcon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) (submitted text can be found on
the
[shared Codi document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/jVqstrnNQXCjH8cjMFChsA),
scroll down to "as-submitted") was rejected.

#### Workshops

None pending (?).

### The Website

Consensus about the website from the
[July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) was
that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised
Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be
appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of
attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed ->
  [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
  [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with
  [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79)
  that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC
  Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd
  recommend mirroring the structure of SWC
  (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for
  updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on
  https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers &
  website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the
  [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a
  GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs
  would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and
  either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR
  ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73))
  which might need attention

### Carpentries Incubation

The Carpentries have completed the revision of their policy on Lesson Program
Incubation, which is now published in the community handbook. There are a
[series of steps](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation)
lesson programs are expected to complete within an 18-month time-frame,
including our perennial favorite issue, governance, as well as teaching the
curriculum and gathering workshop feedback, as well as thing we haven't spent
much time on, such as on-boarding and formally assigning lesson maintainers.

This has been announced on the Carpentries blog, and cross-posted to the HPC
Carpentry blog -- first post in a couple of years! We should be more active
there.

I think there are no urgent issues here that aren't covered elsewhere, but this
is a slot for anything I have forgotten.

### Other issues

#### Workflow lesson development

The workflow lesson has now been taught three times! And the
[giant PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/14) has
been merged!

It worked pretty well at the LLNL workshop, modified for their Maestro workflow
tool.

Workshop feedback tended to focus on the issue of learners losing their place
as the lesson built up the workflow configuration file. Having access to
checkpoint versions of the file, and maybe a shared document for scratch-pad
info, would help to mitigate this. Positive feedback focused on the
interactivity. Feedback on the pace was mixed.

Also, there has been some github traffic on the Maestro fork, I think.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

We got some
PRs[1](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/454)[2](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/453)
from UCL! This is cross-fork collaboration!

Following up from both last meeting and the SIGHPC Education activity, Alan put
a link in the slack for some folks who have ported their version of the HPC
Carpentry lessons to the Carpentries Workbench, and have a solution for the
snippets problem. Consensus is that it's kind of ugly, the presentation is a
bit noisy.

https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368#issuecomment-2114775113

Some additional discussion about customization tools and snippets arising from
this. Some burden for the lesson writer is necessary, it's important to
minimize the burden for learners.

Many things are possible, with varying degrees of difficulty. It somewhat
resembles the localization problem.

#### HPC Chapel

The [HPC Chapel](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-chapel) lesson has had
some traffic, it's being migrated to the Carpentries Workbench. Reviews are
pending, but this is a good place for some attention. (It's actually been
assigned to Andrew (me!), I plan to get to it soon.)

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Marc-André Hermanns (RWTH)
-

### Conferences and Outreach

A near-term TODO is to polish up the BPHTE manuscript. It's due Monday, Sept.
9, but we plan to have a polished version by the end of today, Sept. 5, so
people can look at it before the 9th.

CarpentriesConnect (Heidelberg) is the week prior to SC'24: **November 12 to
14**. We are _on_, with a workshop on Day 2

RSECon is wrapping up today.

USRSE (Albuquerque) was also accepted, that's coming up **October 15 to 17,**
just need to prepare the talk in time for the actual conference, no
pre-conference deadlines.

### The Website

No news, conference and outreach activities have absorbed most of the
attention. This remains a near-term priority, though.

### Incubation

No immediate line-items, but there is project material on the HPC Carpentry
GitHub organization. There's a couple of views, a
[prioritized list view](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/1)
of tasks, and a
[Kanban-type view](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2).
These views haven't been captured before, so here they are in the notes!

Also Marc-André did not have access to the project, we (Trevor) sent an
invitation to join.

## 17:00 EST Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jean Chang (she/her), Broad Institute
- Jannetta Steyn (she/her)
- Maze Ndukum
- Andrew Pauling
- Jane Herriman, LLNL
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Introductions

Many new faces, good to see! Several Carpentries instructors, possibly helping
us to build up the base of people who can run workshops.

### Conferences and Outreach

Summary of the state of play, similar to the earlier session.

###

### Other Issues

#### Workflow Lesson Development

The Maestro version is now in the incubator, there was some traffic about that.

#### HPC Intro Lesson Migration

Fixed the agenda, it's UCL. Still pending, we should reach out to the various
fork owners to take the lesson to the Carpentries Workbench.

#### HPC Chapel

Summarized, the PR is still pending.
