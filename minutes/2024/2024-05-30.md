# HPCC Co-working Session, May 30, 2024

This session is for hacking on the [webiste repo][website], to triage and/or
address any or all of the many
[issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues) which
our many contributors have thoughtfully identified for us.

There is only one session, it's two hours long and starts at the usual
[earlier][earlier] time.

It's not (yet) on the shared calendar.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

The meeting will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by
[phone][phone]. This is the same Google Meet as usual.

## Agenda

### The Website

Our main [webiste](https://hpc-carpentry.org) has gotten a bit stale over the
past while. This agenda item is motivated in part by some work that Alan O'Cais
already did getting the workshop list updated, but also it has come up at
various times in recent meetings.

The proposed task is to check in on progress on issues identified earlier, and
possibly identify new ones.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST

### What Happened

Made a bit of progress on some issues, mostly with respect to the
[lesson list](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/community-lessons/), which has some
fairly stale content, and inconsistencies.

Dealing with this required a bit of a dive into how the list is constructed,
which is not trivial, there's R functionality that scans a list of Github
organizations looking for repos with particular tags, and constructs the list
from that. We did get as far as removing the old Snakemake lesson (explicitly
called out in
[Issue #74](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/74))
as being in an inconsistent state. This lesson was un-archived, had its URL
corrected, and tags adjusted, so that it now (a) is in a consistent state, and
(b) no longer appears in the list on the website.

This is broadly relevant and sort of preparatory to engaging with
[Issue #79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79),
a well as to possible future lists of "adjacent" lesson we may want to link to
([Issue #47](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/47)).
There's a remaining open question about how to link to broader lessons -- we
could require the target lesson to add tags and ingest those, or have a broader
search and clever filters.

There is also a new issue
([Issue #83](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/83))
about documenting the site construction process. This might be premature if
it's all about to change, but once it's stabilized, we should have a clear
picture of how it works so future updates don't require as much consultation
and/or reverse engineering.
