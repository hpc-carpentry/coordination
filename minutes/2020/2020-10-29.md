# HPC Carpentries Coworking Hours 29 October

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday, with
three time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. Times are subject to change, after discussion & voting via GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues), so please speak
up (or open a new issue) if you are unable to attend due to permanent conflicts
with the existing time slots.

Check your local times below, and join whichever is most convenient. If you
have a permanent conflict and can attend none, please contribute to the
[open discussion](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/21) on
revising the European time, open a new issue for other meetings, or both.

Thanks, and see you soon!

## Europe+

- Hosts: Alan O'Cais & Peter Steinbach
- Check your local time
  [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201029T0900&msg=HPC+Carpentries+Coworking+Hour+Europe)
- we mostly went through our [draft webpage](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/)
  - tried to clean up content that was too carpentries specific
  - this way we hope to focus the content on hpc-carpentry matters and provide
    a green field for more content
  - we hope that future task force meetings can help decide which content
    should be included
  - Should be ready to be transferred over
    - Changed colour scheme
      - Not sure it is perfect, a pro would do better...but it is not hard to
        change
        > Orange is one of those colors that’s a bit dangerous. In fact, some
        > color psychologists say that the color orange is, of all the colors,
        > most closely associated with risk-taking.
    - Included existing lessons
    - Tidied a lot of things up

### Agenda

- We have a new [website](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org)
  - Repo: https://github.com/ocaisa/hpc-carpentry.org
  - Is orange a self-destructive risk-taker?
- We'd like a new
  [logo](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/28)
  - Any artists in our network?
  - Other Carpentries use basic (hand) tools, does an excavator send the right
    message? Power drill? Cf. calculator, protractor, compass, ...
- Scroll up... what were the Asia/Pacific folks talking about? Looks cool!

### Participants

- _name (pronouns) — affiliation — interests_
- Trevor Keller (he/him) — NIST, MD, US — lower-level MPI & CUDA for C/C++
  performance, parallel I/O
- Andrew Reid (he/him) — NIST — Novel workflows for frictionless scientific
  computing
- Annajiat ALim Rasel (he/him) — Brac University — Self contained lightweight
  PoC HPC ecosystem for teaching

### Notes

#### Website

- The new website is built from Alan's personal account; the old website is
  deployed from the organization account. "This is already one website too
  many." Is there some intention of transferring ownership of Alan's repo over
  to the HPC Carpentry org?

  - What's the plan for transitioning?
  - How do we get more than one maintainer?

- Color scheme... appropriately autumn-themed, except many of us are in the
  southern hemisphere, so... a better, more inclusive color scheme would be
  great.
  - No suggestions for what that scheme might be.
- Most of the content is stock Carpentries boilerplate.
  - Get Involved: Twitter works, Slack is generic (need to link to the specific
    channel). Twice-monthly newsletters is setting a _high_ expectation.

#### Logo

Neither Andrew nor Trevor is an artist, so, nope.

- $50 to $200 would be reasonable, based on quick queries on Etsy.
- Where to commission website artwork?
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/30fuca/where_can_i_find_an_artist_to_commission_my/
  - Trevor likes the aesthetic of this work; the artist might be willing to do
    a larger commission?
    https://www.etsy.com/listing/821232006/name-drawings-name-logo-personalized?ref=shop_home_active_1&frs=1&crt=1
- Annajiat will try to find out an artist and comeback with some proposals for
  the logo and banners for landing page as well as the lesson pages.

#### Other Business

Annajiat would like to provision a cluster, and is looking for resources to
help guide the steps through it.
