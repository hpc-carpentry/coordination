# HPC Carpentries Coworking Hours: 26 November

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday, with
three time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency.

Times are subject to change, after discussion & voting via GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues), so please speak
up (or open a new issue) if you are unable to attend due to permanent conflicts
with the existing time slots.

Check your local times below, and join whichever is most convenient.

Thanks, and see you soon!

### Participants

- _name_, _pronouns_, _interests_
- Peter Steinbach, he/him, Machine Learning and (historically) HPC
- Benson Muite,
- Alan O'Cais
- Toby Hodges

### Agenda & Notes

- Combine Europe and Asia co-working hours to 12:00 UTC
- Machine learning material in the incubator, compare with what is in
  Deapsecure
- Agenda for task force meeting - machine learning
- Separate examples

- reviewing learning objectives of hpc-intro modules/episodes

  - first observation:
    https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/11-hpc-intro.md#L23
    these are learner profiles that do not overlap with the learner profiles on
    the main hpc-carpentry page
    https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/blob/master/why-hpc-carpentry.md#environmental-biology,
    see https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/issues/235
    - Issue about learner profiles in the template opened recently:
      https://github.com/carpentries/styles/issues/517
  - created a PR for this https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/pull/236

- domain specific examples/capstones?
  - PS: having domain specific examples/capstones is needed; but we should have
    them available and not mandatory so that instructors can select what to use
  - TH: from a instructor history of several workshops with life science based
    learners, using general examples/capstones is more helpful than having too
    specific exercise topics; too domain specific exercises/capstones
    demotivate people on average more than they help
  - PS: suggest to use one central example to align lessons to; have more
    domain specific examples for sure
  - BM: maybe not only have one central example (like
    [estimate pi](https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/02-01-estimate-of-pi/)),
    also add an alternative for people more into high-throughput-computing (one
    input file, one output file)
