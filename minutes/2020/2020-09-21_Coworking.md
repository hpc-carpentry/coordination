#### Agenda

- Make some labels so that we can filter issues:
  - For proposals:
    - _Proposal_: Should be added to a proposal
    - _Vote_: Should be added to a proposal once it is ready for a vote
    - _Approved_: Should replace the _Vote_ if the proposal is approved
      (according to
      [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html))
    - _Rework_: Should replace the _Vote_ if the proposal is not approved
      (according to
      [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html))
  - In general:
    - _Priority_: Should be added to issues that are considered high priority.
      This might help with people choosing issues to work on during co-working
      (or in general). _Priority_ should be decided during Task Force Meetings
      and the number of open _Priority_ issues should be strictly limited (so
      the label has real meaning).
  - Default labels created for Organisation...but these are only picked up by
    **new** repos. Have to add the same labels to all the existing repos :cry:

#### Agenda

- Overview of GitHub Projects by Sabry Razick
- Review [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html)
  (summarized by Greg Wilson) as a proposed method for organizing our Task
  Force Meetings
- Review the open issues for missing tags & try clearing some

#### GitHub Projects -- Sabry

Demo: https://github.com/Sabryr/Github_projects

GH Projects are a [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
interface for project organization. The board lists the issues and, by default,
has columns for Assigned, In Progress, and Done. It helps to define issues in a
templated way. Instead of dumping you in a blank Markdown window, clicking New
Issue would instead open a more structured interface, with some checkboxes to
help sort issues by topic, urgency, etc. -- create templates as Markdown files
in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES`.

AR: GH Projects look more like task flows than project planning... looks good
for organizing coworking tasks, and trying not to drop anything in flight.

#### Expectations of co-working hours

- Set one hour 2x/month
- Build an international team
- Clearing issues
- Review proposals, notes, ...
- Stay involved in hpc-carpentry

#### CodiMD

If you haven't registered already, type in the username and password you
_want_, then you'll be able to make edits.

#### Discussed: issue #192 , PR

Windows 10 (since Apr 2019 release): now have "ssh" command built-in that can
be launched from "cmd" shell.
