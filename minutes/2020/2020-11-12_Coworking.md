# HPC Carpentries Coworking Hours: 12 November

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday, with
three time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. Times are subject to change, after discussion & voting via GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues), so please speak
up (or open a new issue) if you are unable to attend due to permanent conflicts
with the existing time slots.

Check your local times below, and join whichever is most convenient.

Thanks, and see you soon!

  - Trevor says:

    > https://shellshare.net has come up a few times in Carpentries
    > discussions. The advantage is that it's local to your machine, so the
    > config & environment you generally use will be reflected.
    >
    > If you need to record, https://asciinema.org is the go-to, except it
    > doesn't feature audio. https://github.com/dhobsd/castty may be a better
    > bet for that.

    December meeting should be a consolidated gathering.

  (<https://github.com/ocaisa/hpc-carpentry.org>)

    "thumbs up."

  - Can also use Open Broadcaster, if the config is not daunting to you.

- Start reviewing older issues to see whether they've been addressed, and
  consolidating the open ones
