# HPC Carpentries Coworking Hours

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday, with
three time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. Times are subject to change, after discussion & voting via GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues), so please speak
up (or open a new issue) if you are unable to attend due to permanent conflicts
with the existing time slots.

Check your local times below, and join whichever is most convenient. If you
have a permanent conflict and can attend none, please contribute to the
[open discussion](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/21) on
revising the European time, open a new issue for other meetings, or both.

The meetings will be held, with audio & optional video, through the
`#hpc-carpentry` channel on The Carpentries' Slack. To join, click
[this link](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/). If you have already
joined, login through [this link](https://swcarpentry.slack.com).

Thanks, and see you soon!

## Europe+

The current timeslot for Europe+ is 7:00 AM UTC, though this is being
[actively discussed](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/21).

- Hosts: ~~Peter Steinbach &~~ Alan O'Cais
- Check your local time
  [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201015T0700&msg=HPC+Carpentries+Coworking+Hour+Europe).

### Participants

- _name_, _pronouns_, _interests_
- Alan O'Cais, he,him, (struggling to know what is meant here)
- Benson Muite, he/him , HPC; PGAS

### Agenda

- Adopting Carpentries landing page style
  - See
    [the proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/26)
    and
    [the accessibility issue](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/22)
    that partially motivated it
  - I'll prepare a PR that makes the move and will point hpc-carpentry.org
    (which I bought a while ago so we wouldn't get scooped) to my branch for
    the time being.
    - This was discussed a bit about how to do this and how to make it
      welcoming for new material from other sources
    - The incubator page exists on the Carpentries page and would be part of
      our clone, one option is to use that

## Asia-Pacific

## Americas

- Hosts: Trevor Keller & Andrew Reid
- Check your local time
  [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201015T2100&msg=HPC+Carpentries+Coworking+Hour+Europe).

### Participants

- _name_; _pronouns_; _interests_
- Trevor Keller (NIST); he/him; GPU, I/O, microstructure
- Mike Renfro; ;
- Andrew Reid (NIST); ;

### Agenda

- Requirements to join the Incubator

### Notes

Mike has started work on a Bandwidth & Latency diagram. Looks good so far!

Poked around with manual lesson ordering. It works! The trick is to enumerate
the lesson file names, _without_ the `.md` extensions, in your site's
`_config_options.yml`. We can start renaming.

```yaml
episode_order:
  - 11-hpc-intro
  - 12-cluster
  - 18-responsibility
  - 13-scheduler
  - 14-modules
  - 15-transferring-files
  - 16-parallel
  - 17-resources
```

#### Incubator requirements

https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals

[What are the requirements for being included in The Carpentries Incubator?](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals#what-are-the-requirements-for-being-included-in-the-carpentries-incubator)

- [x] Your lesson/proposed topic should be distinct from existing official and
      community developed lessons.
  - HPC-intro in particular is distinct from other content in the incubator.
    The less-developed lessons are as well, with the possible exception of HPC
    Python, which may overlap with some Snake-make efforts. Modifying this
    lesson to get to HPC-Python and incorporate existing material by reference
    should be straightforward.
- [x] Your lesson must use our lesson template and conform to our Code of
      Conduct.
  - We are confident that we are using the Carpentries template. We refer to
    their remote theme at build-time, and also the "episode_order" thing
    totally worked, and it relies on functionality inherited from the
    Carpentries infrastructure.
- [x] Your lesson is licensed CC-BY or CC-0.
  - We are using CC-BY 4 as our license. It's in `LICENSE.md` at the top of the
    hpc-intro repo, and is in fact copied from the Carpentries.
- [x] The displayed life-cycle stage of your lesson fits with the
      recommendations in
      [Chapter 7 of the Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html#overview-and-definitions).
  - For the curriculum-development material, we've been working within the
    Carpentries model for some time, but should double-check that we're on
    solid ground here. HPC-intro is in
    [_alpha_ state](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/blob/8102c9e998acf4ba778d7c16d13631b40af4639a/_config.yml#L80).
- [ ] Your lesson follows The Carpentries approach to curriculum development
      detailed in our
      [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html).
  - Peter Steinbach has mentioned the Handbook several times, so we can assume
    that the bulk of HPC-intro conforms. Or, we can double-check.
