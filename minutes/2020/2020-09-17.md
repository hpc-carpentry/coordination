# HPC Carpentry Task Force Coordination

Welcome! This CodiMD notepad is intended to collect notes and common threads to
keep track of the Task Force for HPC Carpentry. The "Task Force" refers to all
members of the
[HPC Carpentry Organization](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/people), and
more specifically, the
[HPC Intro Maintainers Team](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/teams/hpc-intro-maintainers).

_There are two types of meetings: **Coordination** and **Coworking**._

The Coordination Meetings are intended to gather as many of us as possible into
just two virtual meetings, occurring at 7:00AM UTC and 9:00PM UTC (see
[everytimezone](https://everytimezone.com) to check your local time). These
will be held approximately monthly and as needed, with open discussion for day
& time adjustments. Discussion will focus on planning and assessing the
coworking hours' progress, as well as
[Coordination Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues),
and other items that come up with regards to our aspirations of joining The
Carpentries officially.

The Coworking Hours will occur biweekly (every other), with as many
asynchronous sessions as necessary to comfortably accommodate our members
around the globe -- but not so many that any meeting has fewer than three
participants. These hours are meant to encourage focus and collaboration on
accomplishing specific tasks, as identified in
[HPC Intro Issues](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/issues) or during
a Coordination Meeting.

## Coordination Meetings

Also known as "Task Force" meetings.

The
[First Coordination Meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/ct7yfc_LSseoC8mEmbVEiQ)
was held on 16 September 2020.

The
[Second Coordination Meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/tsMOzEaMQYmeesMGpalVRw?both)
is to be held the first week of October.

## Coworking Hours

### First Coworking Session

Our first Co-Working Hours will be held on **Thursday, 1 October, 2020**. At
present, we have plans for two sessions, with the option for a third if an
organizer volunteers.

- [**7:00AM _UTC_**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201001T0700)
  hosted by Peter Steinbach and Alain O'Cais.
- [**1:00PM _UTC_**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20201001T1300)

- Alan O'Cais / Juelich Supercomputing Centre / he-him-his

Attendees:

- _name / affiliation / pronouns_
- (it was a bit lonely!)

#### Agenda

- Make some labels so that we can filter issues:
  - For proposals:
    - _Proposal_: Should be added to a proposal
    - _Vote_: Should be added to a proposal once it is ready for a vote
    - _Approved_: Should replace the _Vote_ if the proposal is approved
      (according to
      [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html))
    - _Rework_: Should replace the _Vote_ if the proposal is not approved
      (according to
      [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html))
  - In general:
    - _Priority_: Should be added to issues that are considered high priority.
      This might help with people choosing issues to work on during co-working
      (or in general). _Priority_ should be decided during Task Force Meetings
      and the number of open _Priority_ issues should be strictly limited (so
      the label has real meaning).
  - Default labels created for Organisation...but these are only picked up by
    **new** repos. Have to add the same labels to all the existing repos :cry:
    - DONE!!

#### Agenda

- Overview of GitHub Projects by Sabry Razick
- Review [Martha's Rules](https://third-bit.com/2019/06/13/marthas-rules.html)
  (summarized by Greg Wilson) as a proposed method for organizing our Task
  Force Meetings
- Review the open issues for missing tags & try clearing some

#### GitHub Projects -- Sabry

Demo: https://github.com/Sabryr/Github_projects

GH Projects are a [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
interface for project organization. The board lists the issues and, by default,
has columns for Assigned, In Progress, and Done. It helps to define issues in a
templated way. Instead of dumping you in a blank Markdown window, clicking New
Issue would instead open a more structured interface, with some checkboxes to
help sort issues by topic, urgency, etc. -- create templates as Markdown files
in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES`.

AR: GH Projects look more like task flows than project planning... looks good
for organizing coworking tasks, and trying not to drop anything in flight.

#### Expectations of co-working hours

- Set one hour 2x/month
- Build an international team
- Clearing issues
- Review proposals, notes, ...
- Stay involved in hpc-carpentry

#### CodiMD

If you haven't registered already, type in the username and password you
_want_, then you'll be able to make edits.

#### Discussed: issue #192 , PR

Windows 10 (since Apr 2019 release): now have "ssh" command built-in that can
be launched from "cmd" shell.
