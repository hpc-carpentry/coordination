      - Join link for Carpentries Slack:
        https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/

- Updates on lesson development

  - Is hpc-intro ready for a beta release?
    [#174](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/issues/174)

    - Lots of issues opened (and cleared) in the last few months
    - Still a few issues
      - Added an MPI example, would like feedback
        - Has a lot going on that we don't explain
    - It still needs to be taught a bit since the changes
      - Prepare feedback session from people who have given it
      - Field testing and feedback loop
        - Who is material for?
          - Do
            [learner profiles](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/why-hpc-carpentry)
            need updating
        - Motivate people to report feedback from these lessons (psteinb: do
          this in the
          [coordination repo](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordinations))
        - Things to keep track of when "alpha testing" lessons:
          - amount of time used to teach each section
          - amount of time used for each exercise
          - technical issues that arose during installation
          - bugs or parts of the lesson code that didnâ€™t work as expected
          - incorrect or missing exercise solutions
          - questions learners asked (and their answers)
          - parts of the lesson that were confusing for learners (from the
            [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org))
    - What is the timeline for the lesson pilot workshops?

      - HPC Intro is ready to be taught (alpha/beta stage)

    - What about a project board on GitHub?
      - Currently we have information in a lot of different places (need to
        consolidate channels!)
      - Github does have a wiki we can enable
      - Feedback questions (see above) + brief description of audience
    - Do we need to do anything required by the Carpentries?
    - Establish community processes to keep the materials long-lived
      - Shape the entire community?

  - New lesson plans/proposals

    - Interest from EPCC
    - Working on a lesson for LAMMPS => running code at scale. Will touch
      parallel computing aspects on the surface (e.g. cover threads,
      communications, etc but not how MPI or OpenMP really works)

    - For now, focus and consolidate on our existing lessons
      - In the future can affiliate lessons from the community on a separate
        "community contributed" lessons

- Task Force modus operandi (initial suggestions in brackets)
  - Initial discussion in
    https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/12
  - Lifetime (3 months, renewable)
    - to establish community processes to develop & maintain material
    - get the HPC Carpentry material into shape
    - review after 3 months
    - first review: Christmas 2020
  - Minimum/maximum sizes (1/4)
    - 6 to 8 seems more likely given what we have seen so far
    - how much time each of us can commit?
    - Try to establish co-working hours => work on issues, etc for 60-90 mins
      - Experience tells us people only have small amounts of time to
        contribute
      - Small scale, weekly
  - Where to define main task (Milestone in repo)
    - Subtasks (issues and PRs)
    - Do we want to use Milestones or Github projects (linked to issues)
      - Can someone give us a demo? Sabry? (please suggest a date), OK. e.g.
        https://github.com/orgs/coderefinery/projects/6.
  - Time commitment (co-working time of 1 hour a week)
    - keep track of co-working progress in a central codimd (or similar)
      document
    - go with a bimodal model as well for this co-working hour
      - one per week
      - 1 for US+EMEA
      - 1 for EMEA+ASIA/Australia
- Task definitions and volunteers

  - Potential tasks
    - Diversity
      - Need code of conduct
        - Need to officially adopt the Carpentries CoC
      - Could reach out for help with communities already working on diversity
        in HPC
      - Could ideate further on tasks that would help with this goal.
        - HPC is historically very homogeneous
          - Not sure how to facilitate this
        - Get the feel how the materials are taken by different communities
        - Draw contributors from different communities
        - Example communities: Women in HPC (Peter is in contact with Lorna
          Rivera),
    - Carpentries incubator
      - forming a new lesson set in Carpentries
      - Downside: path to the repository changes twice
        - First change: from hpc-carpentry to incubator
        - Would change again if the lesson is accepted to become formal
          Carpentry lesson
      - Instructors who are doing checkout can also help contribute to lessons
        in the incubator
      - when you're ready, open an Issue (one per lesson repository) at
        https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/
    - GitHub triage
    - Updating the landing page
    - Road-testing the lessons
      - put together a system to gather feedback
      - review the feedback and act on it

- AOB
  - Going forward:
    - Anything catches your eyes from this meeting => open an issue
      - Open the issue in https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination for
        now, we can always transfer the issue to another (more appropriate)
        repo later
