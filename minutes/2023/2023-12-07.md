# HPCC Coworking Hours: 7 December 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### SC23 follow-up

Alan, Andrew, and Wirawan were all at SC23, and made some good contacts with
others in the HPC Education community. A summary of desirable follow-up
activities will be presented.

#### Surprise Lightning Talk

In addition to the scheduled lightning talk as part of the BPHTE activity, we
had the opportunity to present at a BoF on "Scientific Software and the People
who Make It", hosted by David Bernholdt, who is active in the RSE community.
"We" ended up doing two of them, Andrew presented an abbreviated version of the
HPC Carpentry talk, and Alan spoke about CECAM.

#### SCA2024

We've been invited to give a lightning talk as part of a larger educational
session at [Supercomputing Asia 2024](https://sca24.sc-asia.org/). We've
accepted, logistical details are pending. This was an outreach success, the
organizer of this session learned about us at SC23, probably through the HPC
Education Pathfinding session.

### Help with the Workflow Lesson!

Some folks from Michigan State U. expressed an interest in helping us out with
the workflow lesson, for which they also have a need. They're already using
Snakemake.

The conference activity interrupted our workflow lesson activities, these
should be resumed in any case. It would be extremely awesome if we could have
the lesson in a teachable state for Alan's
[CECAM February workshop](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1270).

### Virtual Workshop

Annajiat has been running a virtual workshop using [The Cluster][hpc-cluster].
If helpers and instructors are needed, let's get it sorted out.

#### The Cluster

As an aside, the cluster had a certificate problem and Alan had a plan to
transition it to the Jetstream2 resource, which may impact this workshop
activity.

### Bioinformatics Lesson

This item is pending from earlier meetings, updates appreciated.

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US Department of Agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Craig Gross (he/him), Michigan State University
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), Old Dominion University

### Conversation with Michigan State U.

We chatted with Craig Gross from Michigan State. They have a process that
teaches workflow now, mostly at a fairly high and conceptual level, and are
looking for some more hands-on material to help their audience engage with the
material.

Revisited the site-customzation conversation a bit, there is value in breadth
but also value in immediate relevance, this is of course an on-going source of
tension in the content. A possible solution is to have generic basic lessons
and customized domain- and site-specific following lessons. Makes for a longer
workshop, but maybe balances things.

Steps forward: Craig will have a look at the repo and maybe try to ID some
opportunities for exercises, and see if he can get traction among his
colleagues. We will continue our development efforts too.

Probably there is not an opportunity to do a workshop at Michigan State, they
have existing materials and people who have investments in them.

### Upcoming workshops

### HPC Carpentry cluster

Questions:

### SC23 Follow Up

Engagements done:

- BPHTE lighting talk

  - An interest from (someone from Australia)

- "Pathfinding in HPC Education and Training"
  ([event](https://sc23.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=bof140&sess=sess410))

- David Bernholdt (ORNL): connected to RSE.

  - well connected to Exascale Computing Project (ECP), whose funding is
    running out
  - has community building BOF to find ways to preserve the training stuff
    developed during the ECP funding period

Other interesting HPC education/training efforts

- CHPC (South Africa) -- "Cluster in a laptop" using Vagrant, fully offline
  infrastructure
-

### Workflow lesson development

Will be good to focus on this lesson in the coming weeks to make it in a shape
ready for teaching in January / February. Then begin offering workshops on
this.

(First target of delivery: The BioNT workshop:
https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1270 . Alan O'Cais will be teaching
this.)

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), Lawrence Livermore National Lab
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), Old Dominion University
- Annajiat Alim Rasel (he/him), BRAC University

### Snippets Library Demo

This meeting focused on a discussion of how the snippet library works, for
Jane, who was attending. This is important, having folks use the content with
the snippets helps with them sharing back with us the good changes they make to
the thing.

On the general topic of snippets and eventual migration to the Carpentries
Workbench, it came up (from Wirawan) that some sites use different commands to
invoke commands, e.g. Old Dominion U. uses `crun.<modulename>` to invoke a
program inside a container. It's also reasonably common for sites to use `srun`
in place of `mpirun` to launch an MPI executable (inside the sbatch, where e.g.
the number of nodes and tasks per node are already set by `#SBATCH`
invocations), so maybe that's a customization we should _add_ when doing the
migration to the Workbench. As much as possible, we strive to reduce the amount
of customization to the minimum necessary, so as to reduce the customization
burden; but on the other hand, learning the wrong command is needlessly
confusing to users of a specific site, so this might be an example of necessary
customization.

The workbench supports tabbed boxes (cf the "Setup" section in some
Carpentries), that's also an option.

### Migration of "HPC Carpentry" Cluster

A new "HPC Carpentry" cluster will be set up on Jetstream2 to replace the
current cluster on AWS.

Questions:

- When will this happen?
  - Soon, we think.
- Who will do this?
  - Alan O'Cais indicated he would do this. (On Slack, I think?)
- It will be good if the whole process is fully documented
  - Yup.

Wirawan is considering an idea of using HPC Carpentry cluster as a reference
cluster for the DeapSECURE lessons, going forward. This is based on the
assumption that HPC Carpentry cluster uses command names & assumptions that are
representative of a typical HPC cluster.

### Signups for "HPC Carpentry" Cluster

- [name=Annajiat] Some account requests have been submitted to use the HPC
  Carpentry cluster. They need access for training purposes.
  - <ipa.cluster.hpc-carpentry.org> is where to monitor accounts.
  - Will add users upon request -- email notifications about new users are not
    going to everyone with admin rights.

### HPC Workflow Lesson --- Roadmap for Initial Completion

Q: How to get on track with the development of this lesson & get a
teaching-ready initial version of the lesson?

The high-level outline can be seen in
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/1 .

Andrew has made a bunch of Snakefiles that embodies the (see
`cluster_snakefiles` branch, under `episodes/files`):
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/tree/cluster_snakefiles/episodes/files
(Watch out: they are not yet in a particular order)

Next step: After the snakefiles are put together, we need to build exercises
around them. Then build the flesh of the texts.

BEWARE: the snakefile `Snakefile_cluster_iteration` have oddities related to
running a rule that has iteration in it. There may be a better way than what's
currently implemented, we need to weigh which one has better pedagogical value
for new learners.

(A better trick was proposed in issue [FIXME??--cannot find it again
yet]---link to a blog found by Alan.)
