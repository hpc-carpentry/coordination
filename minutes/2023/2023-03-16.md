# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 16 March 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Note that Daylight Saving Time has started in the US, but that due to our
recent changes to the calendar scheme, the later meeting is still at 17:00
Eastern time, though it will have shifted by an hour for non-US locations. The
[Google Calendar][gcal] remains authoritative.

## Agenda

### The Road To The Carpentries

The plan for this meeting is to finalize our efforts to draft a formal request
to enter the incubation phase, as described in the curriculum development
[handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/).

There's a
[working repository](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request) on
Gitlab.

There are notes from
[the initial meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/h4bbHqmuQcCJ3jDeyUSx6A)
with the Carpentries, which of course informs this process.

By way of scheduling, we learned at the last co-working meeting that the
Carpentries executive council has a retreat they do in April, whose agenda is
solidified in mid-March, so completion and submission by then would be
valuable. Also a deadline might motivate completion, although of course we will
also be respectfuol of people's bandwidth limits.

This meeting's primary agenda item is to complete the report that answers the
questions spelled out in the handbook.

### Other Business

There are numerous other items that would fit as and when time permits.
Principally the status of the Snakemake lesson, which is an important piece of
actually building a coherent workshop, rather than a less-coherent collection
of material.

## 1300 CET Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Susan Branchett, TU Delft

#### Edits to the document

- Did a bit of grammatical and formatting clean-up.

- Outstanding issues:
  - Timing -- will auto-resolve when we pull the trigger.
  - When/where the material has been taught?
    - Covered in "state of the community".
  - Curriculum advisory committee -- have some ideas?
    - Adjacent to learner-to-helper-to-instructor pipeline?
    - Instructor knowledge paragraph exists.
      - Should extend with "Instructor Onboarding" intentions: adapting a
        lesson to purpose is not trivial.
  - Existing lessons? Covered informally in the "existing content" section.
  - Identify the various forks:
    - [x] Maybe mention them? Describe the outreach effort?
  - Additional lessons -- speaks to the breadth of our ambition. Maybe too
    forward-looking?

#### Actually happened:

Did some re-formatting and wordsmithing on the document to try to capture the
intent of the more forward-looking points we want to make -- this is
necessarily vague, but does at least mention the resource requirements, the
history (thanks Alan!), and our vision for the learner-to-helper-to-instructor
pipeline. Substantive edits are in
[MR #15](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request/-/merge_requests/15)
on the repo. There was a follow-up MR to take care of a few minor edits (and in
particular the final heading).

"We" (TK and AR) now think the document is pretty much final.

There will shortly be a message on the slack announcing our intent to submit.

## 1700 EDT Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST

There was an additional MR from Benson, which had some useful additions, which
were incorporated.

We again think it's good to go.

Q: Go where? The Carpentries Executive has an e-mail.

Message sent. Yay!
