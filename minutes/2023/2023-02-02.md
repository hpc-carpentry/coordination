# HPCC Coworking Hours: 2 February 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

The Carpentries' [Lesson Development Handbook][ldh] requests that the
application document cover the following items _at a minimum_. Including this
list at the end, with links back to the relevant clauses, would be helpful.
Answering in the form of an itemized list would not be.

1. Description of the community that is working on the Lesson Project
2. Description of domain knowledge required for instructors to teach the
   material, so that we can determine to what extent our existing instructor
   pool may possess these skills and be able to teach these workshops
3. Description of the community that the Lesson Project serves with their
   workshops
4. Goals of the Lesson Project
5. List of the lessons developed or under development and what a two-day
   workshop would include, along with access to the materials for Carpentries
   review
6. Information about when and where at least some of the materials have been
   taught, even if as smaller modules and not yet a full-fledged 2-day workshop
7. Assessment information from the teaching events regarding number of
   attendees and learner feedback about the workshop(s), either using The
   Carpentries standard surveys or custom survey questions
8. How the Lesson Project feels that becoming an official Carpentries Lesson
   Program will benefit the Lesson Project, The Carpentries, and the broader
   learning community.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- _name & pronouns, affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jean Baptiste Fankam Fankam(he/him), Wits University, South Africa
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries

#### Lesson links for Jean Baptiste (and other HPC [Carpentry] beginners)

- [Introduction to High-Performance Computing]
  (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/) - lesson repository:
  https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/ - "snippet library" that
  can be used/extended to customise lesson for your local HPC
  cluster/environment:
  https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/tree/gh-pages/_includes/snippets_library

#### Amdahl's Law

There is
[a PR awaiting review](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/411)
that revises HPC Intro to use our Amdahl code instead of the pi calculator.
Please take a look! Merging this will help firm up the narrative around the
default HPC workshop.

#### TODO for the Lesson Program Incubator Application

<https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request>

(Resuming work & discussion from the last [Coordination][last-coord] and
[Coworking][last-cowork] sessions)

- Identify the various forks. Contact the fork owners and get feedback from
  them, decide how to represent these in the community description. (Relevant
  to question #3, and #6 and #7.)
- Make a list of all the lessons, including lessons we own and lessons derived
  from what we own. (Answers question #5) (Include ODU's Deapsecure effort, Big
  Data)
- Include narrative content that answers Q#2. This will vary across lessons.
- Figure out a governance and lesson improvement model that will work for more
  HPC people who may attend fewer meetings, but will review and teach material.
  Relevant to Q#8 in that it's a benefit of becoming a Carpentries activity.
  Also relevant to the impedance mismatch between our lesson structure and
  typical Carpentries lesson structure. (Snippets!)
  - [name=toby]: when describing the reasons for the snippet library's
    existence, you may find it persuasive to refer to
    [Tip 2 of the _Ten Quick Tips for teaching with participatory live coding_ paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090#sec005)
- Describe the history better -- emphasize continuity across leadership changes
  (departure of Steinbach and Koch), affiliation with Compute Canada.
- Identify candidates (from the diaspora?) for a possible future curriculum
  advisory committee.

#### Activity

Andrew hacked up a couple of MRs to address issues. There's an
[MR](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request/-/merge_requests/9)
for [issue #6](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request/-/issues/6)
and an
[MR](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request/-/merge_requests/8)
for [issue #5](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request/-/issues/5)
(Instructor domain knowledge).

### Other Business

- Take a look at
  [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/good-enough-practices/)
  in The Incubator!

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan Sill, Texas Tech

Had an interesting conversation with Alan Sill, who is the managing director of
the High-Performance Computing Center at Texas Tech, and has been meaning to
make contact with the HPC Carpentry community for some time.

Alan and his team have recently stood up some HPC-oriented social media
resources, including at Mastodon instance, all reachable via the portal at
[hpc.social](https://hpc.social).

This is potentially a good way to reach out to potential instructors and
contributors for our team, it's another piece of the HPC world that we can
perhaps connect with. We can also potentially contribute, there is a demand for
instructional material and activities, which we can of course provide.
