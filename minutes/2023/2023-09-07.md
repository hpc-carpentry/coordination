# HPCC Coworking Hours: 7 September 2023

HPC Carpentries coworking hours are held on the first Thursday of each month,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

### SC23 BoF Post-mortem

Our BoF proposal for SC23 was rejected. Reviewer comments seemed to revolve
around the relatively small number of workshops since the 2021 BoF, and a lack
of clarity in the submission about how we intended to use the info gathered
during the BoF. We'll have a look at the responses, and see what lessons we can
craw going forward.

### BPHTE23 Activity

Our lightning-talk submission submission for the
[Tenth SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte23cfp/)
was accepted!

For those with access, the manuscript is
[editable on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64c7b9fca3602fcb140d6fda).

There is a Sept. 9 deadline for the completed paper. We already submitted a
manuscript that is the extended abstract for our lightning talks, but maybe we
can review it and make revisions, and/or review the submission requirements and
make sure we have all the logistical issues nailed down correctly.

Feedback from three reviewers:

1. "This is a nice description of a careful incubation process for course
   materials that are valuable to the entire community. Hopefully we hear more
   details about the steps you took, the challenges you encountered and how you
   worked to develop materials that are ready for the incubation steps. It
   would be good for the community to clearly understand what this took so that
   they are prepared and have a guide for creating additional resources."

2. "It would be valuable to have more experience presenting HPC Carpentry, to
   learn how well it works and how it can be improved."

3. "Thanks for the submission. Seeing recent developments in HPC carpentry and
   perhaps some advanced content would be good. It would be good to learn more
   about community engagement in content development."

### Virtual Workshop

There as been discussion of (demand for) a virtual, world-wide HPC Carpentry
workshop. Shall we schedule something? Who's willing to serve as Instructors?

### Workflow Lesson

There has been some progress offline on [HPC Workflows][hpc-workflows] using
The Cluster (cluster.hpc-carpentry.org). Let's put our heads together and
exercise Snakemake and the lesson materials some more.

### Any other business

_Please add items here._

## 13:00 CEST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/University of Barcelona
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito

### SC23 BoF

Shared the feedback with the meeting attendees. Reviewers varied a little in
opinions, but a clear through-line is that we were not clear about how we were
going to use the feedback from the BoF to improve the lessons. Reviewer 1 was
explicit about this. Reviewer 2 noted the paucity of workshops, and suggested
that we might benefit from workshop feedback in favor of BoF feedback. These
are two different kinds of feedback, and both are valuable, and the reviewer
didn't make what is to us an important distinction -- this is maybe also lack
of clarity on our part. Reviewer 3 also called out a lack of clarity in the
structure and goals, which is similar to Reviewer 1 comments.

Going forward, if we want another BoF, we should be clearer about what we want
our take-away to be, and how BoF feedback would differ from learner feedback.

We could also apply for an actual SC tutorial in the future, since tutorials
are what we do. Related, we could try to road-test some instructor-onboarding
("training the trainer") activities. SC tutorials are competitive, but this is
closer to our primary activity.

SC attendees would not be typical of HPC Carpentry learners, and perhaps we
could have been more clear on that. But I do agree that what we probably really
need is more workshops.

### BPHTE23

Desired improvements based on the feedback:

- [Hoping to ] "hear more details about the steps you took [in the incubation
  process], the challenges you encountered and how you worked to develop
  materials that are ready for the incubation steps"

  - Tracking down forks - translations, improvements, changes...
    - Some cheered us on
    - Novice HPC users are not why people are forking, [but rather] using the
      material as a grab-bag
    - Need to reach out to actually find the people who have the problem that
      we solve
  - How do we keep people involved who are forking (NeSI in New Zealand is a
    good example, they have a lot of R content now but are still interested in
    the core)

- "It would be good for the community to clearly understand what this took so
  that they are prepared and have a guide for creating additional resources."

  - Links back to previous point perhaps
  - Talk about making the call to focus on the workshop tracks, and controlling
    scope. Dovetails with the heterogeneous structure from the "advanced
    content" point 2 below.

- [Wanted:] "have (?or share?) more experience presenting HPC Carpentry, to
  learn how well it works and how it can be improved"

  - More workshops!
    - Not actionable in the manuscript :(
  - Sharing some "lessons learned" from our current workshop offerings would be
    heklpful.

- [The referee would like to see] "recent developments in HPC carpentry and
  perhaps some advanced content"

  - Punch up the heterogeneous nature of the resources. Current focus is on a
    workshop covering introductory material, but the "grab-bag" content is
    still welcome. (NB Carpentries itself is not hostile to "grab-bag" content
    either, that's part of what the lesson incubator is about.)

- [Want to] "learn more about community engagement in content development"

Sidebar about workshop strategy: A desirable place to be would be to have a
solid core workshop (shell, HPC Intro) that can then have a customized final
lesson that is maybe domain-specific. Reaching out to application communities
(LAMMPS was the example discussed) to see if they were interested in doing a
workshop that builds on our material? Or reduce the friction in developing
application-specific lessons? The idea is to get these communties to invest in
building on our core introductory material and get them to
contribute/strengthen it.

Action item is to maybe reach out to these communities and get their level of
interest. This might be easier if we have more momentum and mindshare, so after
we have a few more workshops under our belt, and we're already unclear on the
level of interest in the base workshops.

Action: Andrew will make edits along these lines today, and we can collaborate
on the slack.

### Virtual Workshop

Annajiat's audience is available in the first week of October. Ideally this
would be a community effort, so Annajiat doesn't have to solo. We'd do this
on-line, in part because the school network is on-line. Approximately 50
learners. Detailed planning should start now.

Benson and Annajiat will be speaking to the Intel user group meeting later in
September.

### Workflow Lesson Hacking

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto, Old Dominion University
- Alan Sill, Texas Tech University

### iMasons Activity

Alan Sill joined this session, reminding us of the
[Infrastructure Masons](https://imasons.org/) folks. They have recently been
working with some city infrastructure people who have a workforce development
requirement from the Autonomy Institute associated with
["PINNs"](https://autonomy.institute/public-infrastructure-network-nodes-pinn/)
("Public Infrastructure Network Nodes")

They try to focus on public-infrastructure workforce shared training.

### SC23 BoF

### BPHTE23

Review of morning discussion.

### On "novice HPC users" being served by HPC Carpentry

Regarding "novice HPC users"

- Who are they?
-

Recalled: Recent engagement with people from "Digital Research Alliance of
Canada" (was: Compute Canada). What was it that we can help them? Their answer
seem to be "nothing."

- Most people that DRA person is engaged with are people who are not novice;
  they already know what to do on HPC.
- Most HPC center operators seem to think that their problems are solved. Our
  impression when talking to HPC operators seem that they were content with the
  training that they already have for their own training materials.

People who originally contributed to HPC Carpentry was HPC operators who felt
the need of training for novice users. But since that inception of "HPC
Carpentry" the originators have moved on.

Goal for this SC-related engagement in 2023: Talk to people who are in
education/training scope (e.g. SIGHPC education, BPHTE, ...) to find where
novice users whom we can help.

"Novice HPC users" are part of the broader spectrum of the digital
infrastructure training community, that is not limited only to the novice. If
we can talk to this greater community, we can have greater success.

The industry are desperate to find "people who knows how to do things". This
kind of training

Alan Sill's experience: Desperate for people to help the operation/support of
university HPC centers: He has been hiring students to work on the HPC center.
They were usually successful to land very good jobs.

It is a full graduate assistant research assistantships with salaries & extras.
They are not required to pursue the field of HPC going forward, but they remain
on their own field of study (e.g. chemistry, bioinformatics), but they need to
be aspiring in gaining HPC expertise. The thesis project needs to be jointly
agreed upon by the student's adviser and the HPC center. This program has been
very much liked by the professors since it gives them additional source of
funding and input of HPC expertise into the respective disciplines.

Another effort: US-RSE (ref: Dan Katz, etc.) has been a successful effort. It
led to professionalization of research software engineering as a field. Can
this kind of approach work for professionalization of HPC experts?

(----)

Back to HPC Carpentry: Our goal is to remove friction from people who aspire to
use HPC, because there was no easy way to learn HPC on their own. The goal is
to leverage the workshop best practices already developed by the Carpentries
(with muscle memory, & enough keywords, knowing enough to find the right info
on Google when needed).

The goal in the far future is that the scientific community will be unafraid
with HPC if they identify a problem that lends itself for HPC processing.

The challenge from my experience (Andrew's): I have been crossing boundaries
all the time: the science itself, infrastructure, coding, etc. In contrast, the
approach taken by US-RSE is one of a strong "separation of concerns" where
people specialize (e.g. the PI have little expertise.

Alan mentioned: "hpc.social" => social media for HPC.

What if we perform a survey (real survey), or a survey of introductory material
offered by HPC shops across the world => of what quality, what expected level
of baseline skill, ...

Not familiar with the Carpentries? Many HPC center folks may not be familiar
with what the Carpentries are doing, and how they approach thing. Check this
out -- a testimonial that New Zealand eScience effort is greatly supported by
the Carpentries:
https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/08/NeSI-as-a-Carpentries-champion/ .

What might be a challenge of HPC Carpentry? Whereas the "Carpentries" have been
successful because there is a unifying need for people coming from extremely
diverse disciplines (e.g. all of these people would need to program in Python),
thus it solves a large segment of the community. Is this true for HPC? The
commonality could quickly disappear (e.g. people who run Matlab code would have
very different requirements from people who run [or write] quantum chemistry
codes at large scale).

The target audience for HPC Carpentry would fall into "basic users" and "code
developers". They would be scientists and engineers who have pressing needs to
use HPC to solve their problem.

Question for HPC Carpentry folks: Have you defined the measure (metrics) of
your success of training effectiveness for this training program?

- Is it measured by the number of users now enabled to run jobs on HPC, instead
  of turning away from HPC becaused of frustration?
- Or, the building of a community of HPC-user people who are competent in using
  HPC and can promote HPC availability & power to their colleagues or
  respective disciplines?

We need to put some thoughts on this.
