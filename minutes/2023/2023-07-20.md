# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 20 July 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Agenda

### Connecting With Our Audience

At the second session of the [previous co-working session][last-cowork], there
was a conversation with Alex Razoumov, keeper of the
[HPC Chapel](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-chapel/) lesson and participant
in the earlier Compute Canada efforts from which we drew a lot of our content.

The general topic was the utility of reconnecting the efforts, and Alex's
opinion seemed to be that, as facility operators, we have relatively little to
offer, since they have developed their own material following the "grab-bag of
lessons" model, and feel like they are addressing their audience.

This motivates (or perhaps clarifies) a thought: An on-going mismatch in our
efforts is that the people who have developed and continue to develop our
lesson materials are not the audience. Reconnecting with prior developers is
still an excellent idea and we should do that, but we should also be making
some kind of effort to connect with institutions or communities that have the
problem we aim to solve, and our co-development partners might not be they.

This is mostly a somewhat-disorganized intuition at this point, but it's a
solid topic for a coordination meeting conversation.

### Updates to the Workflow Lesson

The strategic plan includes a workshop that includes the [workflow
lesson][workflow-lesson], and development of this is a logical priority at this
point.

There has been some recent progress.

#### Carpentries Workbench and R-Studio on the Cloud

Alan O'Cais has generously made a cloud-based cluster available, with snakemake
installed via a module. This is a good place to do lesson testing, and possibly
also development, using the also-installed the R-studio infrastructure. (Q: Is
R-studio present on the recently re-imaged version?)

#### Lesson Episodes and Objectives

The current version of the [repo][workflow-lesson] has skeletal files for some
of the content outlined in
[Issue #1](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/1), so
the proposed outline is starting to take shape.

#### Carpentries Workbench and Customized Content

Work on setting up snippets for the new cloud environment, and making that the
default, is underway, including reducing the number and scope of the snippets.
Comments and discussion on this effort are welcome.

There is a
[proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/122), the focus
of which is on the snippet library currently in use in our [HPC
Intro][intro-lesson] lesson, but which could be adapted to the new lesson.

Many resources have been ID'd on the
[slack channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T) also.

## 1300 CEST Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him)
- Annajiat Alim Rasel
- Wirawan Purwanto, ODU

### Outreach

Goal: Identify communities that we can support with HPC Carpentry (or that they
can buy into our efforts, help us as instructors, contributors...)

- Which learner communities can we help?
- How can we enlarge the set of instructors and contributors?
- Can we identify common lesson needs?
  - advanced contents, e.g. containers, ...
- Question:

Perhaps the people who already know about HPC Carpentry (and have developed
content in the past) are doing their own thing and have migrated out of scope
for us. Where can we find and meet people who are looking for _novice_ training
materials? (Motivated by chat with A. Razoumov, who has a mature curriculum and
would be interested in cutting-edge techniques more than introductory
materials.)

Do we know of some domains in need of introductory training?

- Molecular biology / gene sequencing
  - At NIST, we worked with some folks who needed to migrate an R workflow off
    their laptops bc it took longer than a workday to run. Dove pretty quickly
    into a scaling study.
- Density functional theory folks already use the cluster, but not in
  sophisticated ways.

Another suggestion from Toby:

- Schedule a workshop using <https://cluster.hpc-carpentry.org>, advertise it
  in advance, offer it for free, but require a commitment to provide feedback
  (written or in a 30-min sit-down)
- Suggest attendees become Instructors for their community

Benson mentioned a thing ...

- [name=Toby]: and don't forget the US-RSE call for lightning talks
  https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/call/ (due 11th August)

What other lesson programs cover?

- ACCESS HPC monthly workshop series:
  https://www.psc.edu/resources/training/hpc-workshop-series/ . But this does
  not cover the basics of HPC needed by novice.
  - They use interactive shell on nearly everything, thus hiding the job
    scheduler & its complexity
- Also look at other learning materials:
  https://support.access-ci.org/knowledge-base
  - Where are the gaps of elementary knowledge that HPC-carpentry can meet?

### HPC Carpentry cluster

- Tested user sign-up for Wirawan
- The user sign-up can be accessed from <https://cluster.hpc-carpentry.org> =>
  click "Create Account"
- HPC Carpentry admin needs to approve (From the backend) (currently Andrew and
  Trevor are admins)

Comments on the cluster:

- Currently, no time limit =>

### Workflows lesson

#### On challenges & objectives

You do not have to have an exercise(s) for every objective. But need to have to
measure the progress of learners' understanding along the way.

Frequent misconception: New learners may have a thought that the codes (rules)
in the Snakemake will execute from the beginning to the end, akin to how a Bash
script works.

In 3rd episode
([More Complicated Snakefiles](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-workflows/snakemake_multiple.html))
on creating a "multi-rule" Snakefile, can we show them the point.

- [name=Toby]: From the lesson objectives, we need a Snakefile with multiple
  rules, which can be parallelised. It "runs the Amdahl example code over a
  range of parallel widths" (not completely sure what that means), and I think
  those need to be dispatched to the cluster in parallel rather than
  one-at-a-time?
  - Past comments on issue #1 suggest it should contain at least one
    'localrule'?
  - Andrew: not sure if we will need a local rule - maybe running the code to
    generate the plot at the end?

So seems like there is one episode missing - a final episode to plot out the
results of the Amdahl code runs and wrap up the workshop.

## 1700 EDT Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- George Ostrouchov (he/him), ORNL & UTK

### Other Business

- George is joining as the original author of the new R materials for HPC

- Alan is joining to raise awareness of the iMasons' effort to develop digital
  infrastructure training. (Personally interested in analyzing & reducing the
  energy impact of HPC.)
