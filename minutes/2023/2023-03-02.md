# HPCC Coworking Hours: 2 March 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Requirements for the Lesson Program Incubator Application

The Carpentries' [Lesson Development Handbook][ldh] requests that the
application document cover the following items _at a minimum_. Including this
list at the end, with links back to the relevant clauses, would be helpful.
Answering in the form of an itemized list would not be.

1. Description of the community that is working on the Lesson Project
2. Description of domain knowledge required for instructors to teach the
   material, so that we can determine to what extent our existing instructor
   pool may possess these skills and be able to teach these workshops
3. Description of the community that the Lesson Project serves with their
   workshops
4. Goals of the Lesson Project
5. List of the lessons developed or under development and what a two-day
   workshop would include, along with access to the materials for Carpentries
   review
6. Information about when and where at least some of the materials have been
   taught, even if as smaller modules and not yet a full-fledged 2-day workshop
7. Assessment information from the teaching events regarding number of
   attendees and learner feedback about the workshop(s), either using The
   Carpentries standard surveys or custom survey questions
8. How the Lesson Project feels that becoming an official Carpentries Lesson
   Program will benefit the Lesson Project, The Carpentries, and the broader
   learning community.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST CTCMS
- Alan
- Toby
- Benson

#### Amdahl's Law

The PR was merged, and the lesson now describes Amdahl's Law rather than pi.
Rejoice!

#### Workshop Requests

At our [Coordination][last-coord] meeting, interest in reviewing the
[Workshop Request Form](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/request-workshop/) was
raised. In particular, it never asks what date is requested.

#### Other Business

1. Toby met some folks at the German RSE Conference, and collected addresses
   for some folks interested in our efforts.

   **_Big Question:_** How do we "on-board" new community members? Invite them
   to the Slack, the next meeting, the GitHub, ... ?

   ([Slack invite link](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/))

   Alan suggests directing people more specifically toward lesson/curriculum
   repositories in need of contributors.

2. Coordination vs. Coworking: same attendees for both meetings, but shouldn't
   the Coworking Hour be more open and cover more topics than whatever the
   Steering Committee is currently working on?

#### The Road to The Carpentries

::: info The Carpentries executive council retreat is in April, so if we had a
completed document by mid-March, that would be good. :::

<https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request>

From the [previous coworking session][last-cowork]:

> - Identify the various forks. Contact the fork owners and get feedback from
>   them, decide how to represent these in the community description. (Relevant
>   to question #3, and #6 and #7.)
> - Make a list of all the lessons, including lessons we own and lessons
>   derived from what we own. (Answers question #5) (Include ODU's Deapsecure
>   effort, Big Data)
> - Include narrative content that answers Q#2. This will vary across lessons.
> - Figure out a governance and lesson improvement model that will work for
>   more HPC people who may attend fewer meetings, but will review and teach
>   material. Relevant to Q#8 in that it's a benefit of becoming a Carpentries
>   activity. Also relevant to the impedance mismatch between our lesson
>   structure and typical Carpentries lesson structure. (Snippets!)
>   - Toby: when describing the reasons for the snippet library's existence,
>     you may find it persuasive to refer to
>     [Tip 2 of the _Ten Quick Tips for teaching with participatory live coding_ paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090#sec005)
> - Describe the history better -- emphasize continuity across leadership
>   changes (departure of Steinbach and Koch), affiliation with Compute Canada.
> - Identify candidates (from the diaspora?) for a possible future curriculum
>   advisory committee.

Please take a fresh look at the
[document](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry/incubation-request): it has changed
since [our last meeting][last-coord]!

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- _name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST CTCMS
- Alan Sill (he/him), Texas Tech University / NSFCAC

Suggestion to try to create links to the new effort from previous HPC Carpentry
pages (and possibly vice versa) - right now there is not a lot of information
on the older sites to this current effort.

Alan also provided a link in the HPC Carpentry Slack channel to the new NIST SP
800-223 (Draft) High-Performance Computing (HPC) Security: Architecture, Threat
Analysis, and Security Posture:
https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-223/draft. This document is
open for public comment until April 7 and also includes a nice general overview
of HPC that could be useful as a reference.

Alan is willing to ask the staff at the Texas Tech HPCC to review any materials
and/or courses as they emerge. A link to the currrent HPCC training materials
at Texas Tech is https://www.depts.ttu.edu/hpcc/about/training.php in case it
is useful.
