# HPCC Coworking Hours: 6 July 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] — better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] — better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Carpentries Coordination

We got an encouraging reply on June 21 from the Carpentries Program Committee,
which will recommend HPC Carpentry for Lesson Program Incubation status at the
next Carpentries executive meeting at the end of August. More details on the
objectives and milestones appropriate to the lesson incubation stage will be
made available after the vote.

Apropos of this, Trevor and Andrew will report on their progress drafting the
relevant committee charters. From last month's co-working meeting:

> It's not actually required to have a separate committees for program
> governance and curriculum, but it's probably a good idea to separate the
> concerns so that the respective meetings can have better focus.
>
> The Carpentries handbook calls the curriculum committee an "advisory,", but
> "development", as it was referred to informally in the meeting, is also
> legitimate, and possibly a better description of what it will actually do for
> us at our stage in the process, where there is a ton of development to do.

## SC23 Activities

### BoF

The SC23 BoF submisison deadline is July 7, 2023 (**_tomorrow_**).

Draft
[submission materials](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/tree/sc23/conferences/SC23)
are on a new [sc23](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/tree/sc23)
branch of the coordination repo (to be merged once we're happy with it.) As of
writing this agenda, the abstract and description text are probably OK, but
don't punch up the diversity/democratization angle as much as they perhaps
could, given that "democratization" is one of the listed topic areas for SC23.
Also the "Session Leader Information" is just guesses at names of participants
-- probably the form will want e-mails, and a one-sentence biographical sketch
would probably be a good idea.

### Other Tutorial Coordination

As mentioned last meeting, the
[Best Practices for HPC Training & Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte23cfp/)
activity from the SIGHPC Education group is also a place we could perhaps
contribute. Deadline is August 12.

From e-mail traffic, it seems that there are some other things going on --
Alan's team got their tutorial approved, so Alan will likely be at SC23, and
Benson is doing tutorial proposals based on HPC Intro for the
[CARLA](https://www.carla2023.org/en/call-tutorials) conference in Latin
America -- deadline was July 1.

Also, US-RSE lightning talk (also at SC23): https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/

SIGHPC Education chapter might have a meeting that we may want to be part of
also.

## Workflow Hacking

This seems to have sort of been overtaken by administrative tasks, but is still
something we should prioritize.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him/his), no official affiliation until Sept '23
- Alan O'Cais
- Trevor Keller
- Wirawan Purwanto

### SC23

Lots of live-hacking on the
[proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/blob/sc23/conferences/SC23/sc23_proposal.md).
Revised draft is commit
[eddc7fd4](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/commit/eddc7fd405c42bf927be372bee1f5c735dbbc702)
(on the SC23 branch of the coordination repo).

Several things to add/consider:

- Help new (prospective instructors) to set this up on their clusters
- Need to mention the approach to teach these materials, like the Carpentries
- How to get community to provide feedback / a way to communicate with HPC
  Carpentries team?
  - See "new issue mechanism" below.
- Q: Is it possible to teach HPC Carpentry without requiring the in-depth
  knowledge that we (steering committee / HPC sys pros) have?

### Moar workshops!

The cloud cluster is up and running, could be used to host a workshop once
snippets are written for it. Good exercise in adapting content to a new
resource, plus more workshops is good.

- Alan is going on vacation, so sign up for an account!
- Trevor is an admin, and may be able to approve new accounts.

### New issue mechanism

Toby mentioned there's a new template scheme for issues. An
[example](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson-alternative)
was presented.
[The mechanism uses a YAML file](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pilot_workshop_feedback.yml?plain=1),
which is rendered into a web form: reasonably easy to adopt.

**Huge caveat**: the result is an _Issue_, which means your feedback is public
on the open Internet.

### Other SC23 stuff

Subsidiary SC23 activities, including the RSE one that Toby mentioned on the
slack, and the other one, an SIGHPC Education activity that is soliciting
contributions. These have early-August deadlines.

#### Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2023)

Call: https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/call/ Submission due date: Aug 11. Event
date: Sun Nov 12.

#### Tenth SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education (BPHTE23)

Agenda: https://sc23.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=wksp124&sess=sess122
Call: https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte23cfp/ Submission due date:
Aug 12. Event date: Mon Nov 13.

#### TODO tasks for SC23:

- Talk to other people doing HPC education efforts and get engaged with them

### RSE

The European RSE community is doing a lot of stuff with Carpentries material.
If there is going to be RSE-focused resources, this is something we could
perhaps hook on to and make a contribution and/or a venue for more workshops.

In US there ought to be such an opportunity as well if the US govt is committed
to increasing investment in HPC to stay on the forefront.

### Questions/Discussions

- Q: Perhaps a naïve question: why does HPC Carpentry need GPUs?
  - GPUs are used by many who work on AI/ML today. Many of these researchers
    are very new to HPC. They often begin by working on laptops.
  - "to help explore the potential impact of developing additional curriculum
    content to help learners get started with GPU computing"
  - as an outgrowth of Singularity container topics?
- Reach out to NeSI folks to interview about their experience with HPC
  Carpentry, in terms of both the material and the community.
  - Diverged back when the Python pi calculator was in the code; converted to
    R. Perhaps there's a re-entrant pathway based on our new Amdahl materials?

### Scalable Resources for HPC workshops

Currently HPC Carpentry has capability to set up a virtual cluster using
MagicCastle. We already have a MagicCastle config to create a
"HPC-Carpentry"-esque cluster. But where can we have the infrastructure to run
(non-cluster-specific) HPC Carpentry workshops?

What we have currently is a tiny cluster, max 40 cores. Needed: To get credits
to scale up the cluster during the workshop. For example, if we have an online
workshop up to 200 learners, it will severely oversubscribe this tiny cluster.

Alan: Looking into
[Jetstream2](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/overview/overview-doc/). But this
requires US academics to lead the effort of acquiring allocation for HPC
Carpentry workshops.

> "Jetstream allocations are awarded exclusively through ACCESS. ACCESS
> provides user accounts free of charge. ACCESS allocations require that the
> Principal Investigator (PI) be a US-based researcher."

(Maybe Wirawan can look into this more and talk to Jetstream folks.)

#### Upcoming need

Transitioning from one to another cloud location that has more capabilities.
Also want GPU capabilities, and want fast interconnect. Why not doing it on
commercial cloud? Because this is an all-volunteer effort, it does not make
sense to host it on an infrastructure that would cost $$.

### Another lesson-related opportunity

Exascale Computing Project is winding down. Looking for people to host the
already-developed materials. If a suitable host is identified, funding might be
available from ORNL.

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
