# HPCC Coworking Hours: 5 October 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Workshops

Annajiat and his team have a workshop coming up. This is a good slot to discuss
related logistical issues. Who will teach? Who will help? One session or two?
And so forth.

## Committee Charters

There has been minimal progress on committee charters. Perhaps a few minutes in
this meeting to try to identify the right axis on which to divide curriculum
from governance?

## Workflow Hacking

This seems to have sort of been overtaken by administrative tasks, but is still
something we should prioritize.

## 13:00 CEST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/UB
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Benson Muite, Kichakato Kizito

### Upcoming Workshop

Apparently no coordination so far, but possibly coordination is not required?
Annajiat does not have admin access to the hpc-carpentry.org cluster, so he
can't approve new accounts, so that seems like a barrier.

Starting time is
[00:30 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Virtual+HPC+Carpentry+Workshop&iso=20231022T0030&p1=1440&ah=4),
go for perhaps four hours, do this on Sundays, 60 to 70 learners, as early as
next Sunday.

- Using the cloud cluster, cluster.hpc-carpentry.org.
- HPC Intro material should be fine on the existing cluster, since the work is
  all faked.
- Any material beyond that needs to be discussed -- make sure the software
  stack is in place.

Possible technical issue, failed SSH connections trigger a ban mechanism, which
has been a problem in the past, this needs to be cleaned up.

If you have a repository of public SSh keys and usernames, it might be possible
to create the accounts and apply the keys.

Might be high-value to include the git lesson, it includes SSH key
infrastructure, but it's not core to the task.

Perhaps set up a pre-workshop survey form? We had something at NIST, maybe
capture that.

### BPHTE Discussion

Brief off-agenda discussion of the SC23 activities. Alan might want to add a
slide that credits his sponsors. We have a five-minute slot, so probably we
should actually plan and practice the talk.

### Committee Charters

We're circling around this, because we lack a clear division of scope between
Governance and Curriculum committees. Our VTCs muddy administrative and
strategic discussions, and that probably is the wrong split for committees.
Whiteboarding, everything looked administrative, so ... ?

(Aside:
[Format of HPC courses](http://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/upcoming-events/2023-10-09_seminar-edinburgh/))

We think there's value in creating two committees: "Governance" to handle some
majority of the work the Steering Committee has been doing, and another to meet
less frequently and tell the Governors what opportunities/communities/niches
have been missed.

- Strategic _vs_ Tactical?
- Content _vs_ Not content? (Everything is content these days)
- Spending _vs_ Acquiring time & money?

The mechanical challenge is assigning _tasks_ to each committee.

Toby: Historically speaking, curriculum advisory committees had a broad scope,
they would consider e.g. how changes to one lesson might impact other lessons,
and help keep the curriculum as a whole coherent and teachable.

- Coordinating the transfer of HPC Shell material into HPC Intro, is a good
  example of Curriculum Committee work.
- We spend a lot of time discussing lesson material, and hardly any
  coordinating workshops, identifying new pools of people to welcome into the
  community, and other things we literally cannot even imagine.
- We can talk to The Carpentries Core Team, for advice.

In the historical scenario, money issues were handled by the Carpentries Core
Team, so it was higher-level than an individual program. Lesson development per
se was not really an organizational unit in this scheme, the lesson team
volunteers were self-propelled.
