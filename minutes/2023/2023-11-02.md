# HPCC Coworking Hours: 2 November 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Time Change

It's that time of year when the clocks go wild for a bit! Europe has gone off
of Summer (Daylight Saving) Time, but America has not yet, so please
double-check your local time.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

(Times in the [shared calendar][gcal] should be correct. Please let Trevor know
if they are not!)

### SC23 Lightning Talk

Andrew will practice delivering The Talk for us.

### Workflow Hacking

Andrew has been writing Snakefiles and making progress on cluster integration.
A status overview would be great, so we all know where the lesson material
stands and how to help out.

### Virtual Workshop

Annajiat has been running a virtual workshop using [The Cluster][hpc-cluster].
If helpers and instructors are needed, let's get it sorted out.

### Bioinformatics

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US department of agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite
- Toby Hodges
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM/UB
- Trevor Kellor (they/them), NIST

### SC23 Lightning Talk

Andrew gave the talk, it ran 8 minutes, but we only have five. Suggested
improvements include more credit to ComputeCanada, who actually coined the term
"HPC Carpentry", corrected affiliation for Alan (or maybe skipping team bios
for time), and maybe front-loading the "why are we here" part, which is
currently at the end, but we don't want to cut that for time.

### Workflow Lesson Progress

A Snakefile that does multiple runs with different widths on the cluster, and a
cluster profile, have been checked in to the repo. The cognitive jump to this
from the prior step feels large.

There's also an
[issue](https://github.com/jdblischak/smk-simple-slurm/issues/20) on the repo
that describes how to not do the function scheme for extracting the width from
the wildcard, and the same scheme lets you do multiple nodes.

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jane Herriman, LLNL
- Wirawan Purwanto, ODU

### Intros

A guest joined, working on teaching/outreach for
[RADIUSS](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/),

> Rapid Application Development via an Institutional Universal Software Stack
>
> RADIUSS aims to develop and deploy a common base of foundational scientific
> software with opt-in adoption from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
> applications in order to reduce long-term software costs and increase
> agility.
