# HPCC Coordination Meeting: 20 April 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds a coordination meeting on the third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Note that Daylight Saving Time has started in the US, but that due to our
recent changes to the calendar scheme, the later meeting is still at 17:00
Eastern time, though it will have shifted by an hour for non-US locations. The
[Google Calendar][gcal] remains authoritative.

## Agenda

### Updates to the Workflow Lesson

The strategic plan includes a workshop that includes the [workflow
lesson][workflow-lesson], and development of this is a logical priority at this
point.

There are multiple subsidiary questions that arise.

At the last [co-working][last-cowork] meeting, consensus was reached that the
lesson should use the cluster resources as soon as is practical, and in
particular should not instruct users to run the stunt executable (the Amdahl
code) on the cluster head node or on their laptops. This may require some
restructuring.

Benson - it may be good to allow for the possibility to run on a laptop. Many
people partially develop locally and then transition their work to remote
resources for execution.

See the list of
[issues](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues) for
multiple potential topics of discussion.

### The Carpentries Workbench

Also, the timing is such that this may be a good opportunity to make this the
first of "our" lessons to use the new Carpentries Workbench. This can
presumably be done more easily at an earlier stage of development than a later
one.

There is a related
[proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/122), the focus
of which is on the snippet library currently in use in our [HPC
Intro][intro-lesson] lesson, but which would also simplify the transition to
the workbench.

Many resources have been ID'd on the
[slack channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T) also.

### Tutorial at CARLA 2023

There is a call for tutorials: https://carla2023.org/en/call-tutorials It is
possible to do some online, though if at least one person is willing to travel
in person is also possible HPC Intro would seem a good fit, though can propose
others

## 1300 CET Session

### Attendees:

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais
- Andrew Reid
- Benson Muite
- Wirawan Purwanto, ODU
- Annajiat Alim Rasel

### Workflow Management

Some discussion surrounding
[issue #35](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/35)
on the workflow lesson, about reconsidering the use of Snakemake, which has
some disadvantages on the cluster. We think that some HPC center
([NERSC?](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/workflow-tools/)) recommends
[Fireworks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/) for larger cluster
jobs, but Fireworks looks like it has a relatively high barrier to entry (and
maybe installation, requires a Mongo database back-end?).

The appetite for changing the workflow tool issue is low, even in light of
this. The case for Snakemake is that it already has some mindshare in the
Carpentries world, and that it has high utility in the bio-informatics space.
We can use this tool to convey workflow concepts that apply across many tools,
and demonstrate them within the Snakemake tool.

### Workflow Lesson Outline

There's a revised outline for the lesson in a
[comment on issue #15](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/15#issuecomment-1515584370),
which however is not mapped to the existing material. Consensus is that this
outline is reasonable.

As to material re-use, this is less clear, and probably the way to do this is
to discover this during lesson development. Revision of the existing repo has
the advantage of retaining the authorship history of the original version.

On the other hand, there is a temptation to start fresh, which would simplify
the migraton to the Carpentries workbench. A clean Carpentries Workbench repo
would give us experience with the Workbench tools without the burden of legacy
content, and might allow us to get some Workbench experience under our belts,
and might simplify the eventual migration of the HPC Intro lesson.

(From Wirawan) Anecdote from interacting with scientists that use HPC: Many
scientific users struggle with workflow (they are in need of workflow tool by
the nature of their computation: Y depends on X, and Z depends on Y) but don't
use workflow management tools, mostly because they're not aware of them.
Instead, they may have achieved excellent level of automation, but so raising
conceptual awareness of the existence of these tools is already potentially
high value, and doesn't depend much on the details of the lesson.

Also, possibly useful to emphasize the existence of many workflow tools at the
start of the lesson, to get learners in a mode where they are mindful of the
concepts and ideas, as well as the specifics of Snakemake that they are typing.
(Certain community is wedded to a certain workflow tool/framework.)

Cognitive burden is a danger -- a learner coming into a workshop from the GUI
world needs to absorb _three_ abstractions:

1. the command-line and file system (away from the familiar "point and click"
   mindset);
2. the queuing system that communicates through _only_ input and output files
   (no nice interactive display); and
3. the workflow tool, which automatically generates output files "under the
   hood" (i.e. directed computation based on flow & dependencies of data).

Expanding the scope beyond this to e.g. multi-site workflow concepts (which
came up in the meeting) is probably too much to attempt.

#### Consensus:

We should start with a clean repo and build the lessson within the new
workbench scheme to the new
[outline](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/15#issuecomment-1515584370).
We can follow Creative Commons guidelines to make sure the authors of the
material we are drawing from continue to get credit.

Do this in the Carpentries Incubator with a new repo. Move the old repo out of
the Incubator and archive it. (Archiving it makes it read-only, it doesn't make
it disappear or destroy information.) (Toby says archived lessons should not
hang around in the incubator.)

### The Carpentries Workbench

The new workbench is based on the R programming language, which might
complicate debugging efforts for folks not familiar with this langauge, but
also many of us were novices to Jekyll not that long ago, and of course the
advantage of using the tool the rest of the community is using is that
community support would be available. We may have a few unique issues
surrounding lesson customization for cluster types, but the overall lesson
structure should resemble other lessons, and will have similar issues, with
similar solutions to the rest of the community.

The actual day-to-day work of lesson development will be in R-markdown files,
and not with R, so a deep knowledge of R is not required for routine lesson
development or modification.

This is also an opportunity to simplify the snippet library. Trevor proposes
having an approach, where there are templates for types of queuing systems
(PBS/Torque vs. SLURM vs. GridEngine vs. others), which you fill out in with
institutional details at the top level. Site- and system-specific edits are
combined and are all in one place. This is less complicated than the existing
snippet library, which is out of control.

This is another advantage of starting from a clean workbench-compatible repo.

#### Consensus

Do this.

### Tutorial at CARLA 2023

This is an HPC conference for Latin and South American countries, tutorials are
aimed at graduate students. Submisison deadline is July 1st. We may be able to
solicit volunteers for Spanish translations of our material.

### New Business

There's an "instructor notes" activity coming up from the Carpentries, it's
been announced on the
[Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/04/instructor-notes-drive-announcement/).
This might be useful to add or update our guidance. It would be fine to work on
the HPC Intro lesson, we don't have to work on "official" Carpentries material.
