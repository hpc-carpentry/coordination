# HPCC Coworking Hours: 4 May 2023

HPC Carpentries coworking hours are held on the first Thursday of each month,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Upcoming Conferences

- When is the deadline for submitting BoF proposals for SC23?
- Other upcoming conferences or activities?

## New Proposals

Trevor will debut Proposals
[122](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/122) and
[123](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/123).

With annual elections coming soon -- after The Carpentries votes on our
Application on 11 May -- Benson would like to revisit our voting system, to
make the ballot box anonymous and secure.

## Hacking on the Workflows Lesson

Our strategic plan promises a workshop that includes [HPC
Workflows][hpc-workflows], so development there is a logical priority.
Attendees are invited to collectively bang on this lesson in a generally
productive way.

## Other Business

Please raise it for discussion.

## 13:00 CET Session

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM

### Proposal 122: Generic Snippet Libraries

The snippets are high-maintenance, and in some cases, "trap" good content in
site-specific material, rather than making it available to everyone. Some of
the snippet library material is important, e.g. loading software. This could be
handled using the Rmd tools in the Workbench (see
[sandpaper #368](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/368): closed,
but answers the snippet/child document question).

Examples:

- [ComputeCanada_Graham_slurm/parallel/four-tasks-jobscript.snip](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/_includes/snippets_library/ComputeCanada_Graham_slurm/parallel/four-tasks-jobscript.snip)
- [ComputeCanada_Graham_slurm/modules/wrong-gcc-version.snip](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/_includes/snippets_library/ComputeCanada_Graham_slurm/modules/wrong-gcc-version.snip)

The idea would be to set, at the top level, "scheduler type" (Slurm, PBS, SGE),
"software environment tool" (vanilla, conda, modules), etc., and have the right
plugins load for the site.

Other examples of detailed info in the snippet libraries... ?

- [Magic_Castle_EESSI_slurm/cluster/specific-node-info.snip](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/_includes/snippets_library/Magic_Castle_EESSI_slurm/cluster/specific-node-info.snip)
- [Magic_Castle_EESSI_slurm/scheduler/option-flags-list.snip](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/_includes/snippets_library/Magic_Castle_EESSI_slurm/scheduler/option-flags-list.snip)

> A lot of the "sugar" is in the `scheduler_specifics` folders.

The difficulty with our `.snip` files is a lack of context, and a lot of
boilerplate. Can we add comments to each providing context?

Lessons will still have _some_ site-specific content, so a mechanism for this
will have to be retained, but it's high-value to minimize site-specific
content, since there will be many more sites than scheduler types. The proposal
does not require the total removal of site-specific content. (Possibly
top-level config can handle this, for e.g. node names, prompts, etc.)

### Proposal 123: Charters for Governing and Curriculum Committees

This proposal is
[#123](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/123) on the
coordination repository.

This is mostly driven by the structure anticipated by the Carpentries
organization, which imagines that lesson programs will have two associated
committess, a governance committee and a curriculum committee. The governnance
committee is roughly equivalent to our existing steering committee, it sets
strategy and directs effort in lesson changes. The curriculum committee would
ideally be drawn from lesson users (i.e. people teaching the material), and
would advise the governance committee on what new or modified lesson content
would be beneficial to the lesson-consuming community.

The mechanics of this are probably a couple of repos for notes and proceedings,
with the charter perhaps being the README of this repo.

(The Carpentries' Executive Council charter is in the
[Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council).)

### SC23 BOF Deadline: July 7

<https://sc23.supercomputing.org/all-dates-deadlines/>

### New "sandpaper" build system documentation

<https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/>

### Action items:

- Review existing snippet content with a view to consolidation along
  queueing-system lines rather than sites.
- Catalog snippet library contents, and sort wheat from chaff.
- Include HTML comments capturing some context in the snippets?
- HPC workflows lesson does build if you configure your environment correctly,
  add some content.

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
