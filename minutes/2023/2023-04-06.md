# HPCC Coworking Hours: 6 April 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Hacking on the Workflows Lesson

Our strategic plan promises a workshop that includes [this
lesson][hpc-workflows], so development there is a logical priority.

There are several [issues][hpc-workflows-issues], but my favorite is the
high-level and still incomplete
[objectives overview](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/15).

Attendees are invited to collectively bang on this lesson in a generally
productive way.

## Other Business

Of course if there is other business, we can take the opportunity of having the
group together to discuss that too.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), on vacation
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Alan O'Cais
- Toby Hodges
- Jean Baptiste Fankam Fankam (He, him)Wits University, South Africa

### Framing

A reasonable goal for today is to review and complete the
[objectives overview](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/15)
and see how much re-usability there really is.

### Discussion

- Should we make this the first of "our" lessons to use the new R-based
  Carpentries Workbench tool to build the lesson?
  - Yes. This lesson does not have as much "snippet intensity" as the HPC Intro
    lesson, and we need to be doing this anyways, so this is a good candidate.
- For Episode 5, Python-in-Snakemake is neat, but not crucial. We will probably
  have "exposed" python that learners will see at this step, the plan is to
  take the "gray box" approach and allow users to see the code.
  - Move the detailed explanation to
    [Ep. 10](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/issues/32).
- For Episode 1, the existing lesson does a worked example (of word counts)
  with an existing data set. Our learners have not run the Amdahl script yet,
  so we don't have data, so we won't do this -- this is a (hopefully minor)
  deviation from the existing flow.
- There is high value in introducing SnakeMake with simple snake files that do
  not use the HPC resource. This introduces some complications, learners may
  need to do this in an interactive session on a node, or on the head node,
  which may interact badly with site policy. The current version of the lesson
  introduces the HPC part quite late in the process. For resource conservation
  reasons, it would be convenient to deviate from best practices, and e.g.
  oversubscribe a node or resource -- this is safe for the Amdahl example,
  because it doesn't actually do anything, but exhibiting deviations from best
  practices is bad.

It feels at this point like we have a clear picture of where we want to go
pedagogically, but there is a knotty technical problem with the scheme where a
lot of work is done initially outside of the cluster, with simple SnakeMake
files. The problem is as above, the obvious pedagogy is hostile to cluster best
practices. Options:

- Embrace the cluster from the start, use it for its intended purpose of
  resource management, so that e.g. the learners first runs will be transient,
  can be interleaved, and there's no need to apologize for deviating from best
  practices. We can maybe start with a simpler-than-amdahl executable, although
  learners should already know amdahl, so maybe not?
- Run the initial interactive material on learner's individual laptops,
  following how non-HPC lessons do things. This involves installing both the
  amdahl executable and snakemake on learner laptops, which is potentially
  fraught.

Option 1 is strongly preferred by the attendees here today.

Also general consensus that writing the first lesson specifically for SLURM,
and adapting later (but keeping in mind that we _will_ have to do this, so not
weaving it in too tightly) is OK.

Also we could allow users to deviate from best practices, and see the
consequences (cancelled jobs, in particular) of that, to reinforce the
shared-resource character.

TODO: Complete the review of the episodes and objectives in light of today's
consensus. Andrew will do this.

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wiriwan Purwanto

### Workflow

Recap of this morning's events.

### SC23

Some brief discussion of possible SC23 activities, including a BoF. Wirawan has
some connections with some of the educational organizations within ACM,
especially SIGHPC Education (distinct from SIGHPC).

Some avenues for engagement (workshops)

- BPHTE (in conjunction with SC), SEHET (in conjunction with PEARC), HETET (in
  conjunction with ISC)

  https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/

- PEARC'23 short paper deadline: April 21 (not SEHET).
- BPHTE'23 deadline: Aug 12. **_Let's try to put something into this workshop,
  in addition to have our own BOF_**
