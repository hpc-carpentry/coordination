# HPCC Coordination Hours: 21 December 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## Agenda

### Help with workflow!

Some folks from Michigan State U. expressed an interest in helping us out with
the workflow lesson, for which they also have a need. They're already using
Snakemake! Logistics of this will be discussed.

### SCA2024

We've been invited to give a lightning talk as part of a larger educational
session at [Supercomputing Asia 20204](https://sca24.sc-asia.org/). We've
accepted, logistical details are pending. This was an outreach success, the
organizer of this session learned about us at SC23, probably through the HPC
Education Pathfinding session.

### Workflow Hacking

The conference activity interrupted our workflow lesson activities, these
should be resumed. It would be extremely awesome if we could have the lesson in
a teachable state for Alan's
[February workshop](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1270)

### Virtual Workshop

Annajiat has been running a virtual workshop using [The Cluster][hpc-cluster].
If helpers and instructors are needed, let's get it sorted out.

### Bioinformatics

This item is pending from earlier meetings, updates appreciated.

The [bioinformatics lesson][genomics-workshop] could/should be adopted to run
on an HPC/big data stack. Currently, each person uses a separate VM (Ubuntu
16.04). A cloud cluster would likely reduce cost as compute cores and memory
can be released. For US department of agriculture, a number of people would
benefit from a shell lesson as a separate portion before moving into
bioinformatics portion. Having the software available in conda, modules, a
singularity container and a guix container would enable the lesson to be taught
in a portable manner.

Many people in this audience use Nextflow, and the [Nextflow
lesson][nextflow-lesson] would be a good fit for an HPC and Big Data
Curriculum. Should reach out to the lesson developers.

## 13:00 CET Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Craig Gross (he/him), MSU
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST

### Workflow

The workshop is coming up in February, interest in this lesson has increased
considerably. Alan is hoping to have a teachable version for the workshop, and
has near-term plans to work on it.

Craig Gross from Michigan State also now has a fork, and is starting to engage.

Also apropos of the upcoming workshop, the intro lesson doesn't have any
coverage of environment variables and their effect on the shell behavior, and
how they are set and unset in the HPC environment.

Since the timelines differ, probably the sane way forward is for Alan to take
the lead on the lesson development, since he has a near-term requirement, and
then revisit distributed development afterwards.

### Virtual Workshop

We did some account approvals last time around.

The `cluster.hpc-carpentry.org` cluster will be migrated to the Jetstream2
allocation, with auto-scaling turned on. A secondary issue is that we should
make some more definite plans to utilize the ACCESS resource, so as not to
embarass ourselves with the allocation.

Also, there's a governance piece to this -- we have been very informal with the
existing AWS-backed cluster, users come on and can stay on as long as they
like, but on the larger resource, there is some danger of users stating to use
it for more serious computation on a persistent basis, and using up disks space
and so forth. We might want to consider using some access-control mechanism to
expire access for learners after some interval after the workshop.

Also, institutional ownership of some of our resources (as opposed to ownership
by a single individual on the team) would be a good idea, especially for the
`hpc-carpentry.org` domain, which costs a small amount of money and requires a
bit of management, and also the social media accounts.

Maybe an institutional repository or password manager or Gmail account or
something.

### Other items

MSU is interetsed in using some of the HPC Carpentry material to replace some
of their intro material. They were interested in HPC Shell, which is
deprecated, but the material is in HPC Intro, so that's the right way forward.

Possible follow-up is to update the site so that it's clearer which lessons and
material are currently under active development and which ones are deprecated,
since this was evidently not obvious to an interested viewer.

## 17:00 EST Session

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Jane Herriman (she/her), LLNL

Possibility of an HPC carpentry workshop at LLNL in the beginning of the
summer, they have tutorials with a fair amount of good content, but not pitched
at truly new users. They have an "intro to LC" ("Livermore computing") that's
kind of a mix of intro-Linux and intro to clusters, but a Carpentry workshop
might be better.

Likely timing might be towards the beginning of June, maybe another one in late
June for the various waves of interns coming through the door.

Maybe revisit this idea in the spring?

Some minor logistical points, they generally do have a special partition for
educaiton, and if it's on-site, most of the users will have accounts on the
relevant system.
