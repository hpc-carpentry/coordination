# HPCC Coworking Hours: 3 August 2023

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [13:00 CEST][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [17:00 EDT][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## VTC: **_[Click here to join!][meet]_**

Both meetings will use [Google Meet][meet]. You may also call in by [phone].

## BPHTE23 Activity

We are working on a submission for the
[Tenth SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte23cfp/)
at the [SC23][sc23] meeting in Denver.

The draft extended abstract is on Overleaf (steering committee members have
invitations), and the deadline is August 12.

This seems to be converging rapidly, but might merit some discussion.

## SC23 BoF

No reponse yet to our BoF submission, other than acknowledgement.

## ACCESS activity

We got an ACCESS allocation (thanks Mike Renfro!) Options for what to do with
it? Should we actually schedule a beta workshop at this point, on either the
ACCESS or `cluster.hpc-carpentry.org` resource?

## Workflow Hacking

This seems to have sort of been overtaken by adminstrative tasks, but is still
something we should prioritize.

- There is an open
  [PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/5).

## Committee Charters

More of a coordination item, but if there's time, we have a pending item to
decide what we want our committee structure to look like as we enter the
Carpentries ecosystem. Carpentries development resources have some guidelines,
but ultimately we should do something that makes sense for our group.

## 13:00 CEST Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Alan O'Cais (he/him), CECAM
- Toby Hodges (he/him)
- Annajiat Alim Rasel
- Benson Muite

### BPHTE23

The document is in very good shape, but there's circumstantial evidence that
some listed authors (Wirawan, in particular) have maybe not had a chance to
fully review.

The plan is to get everyone on the same page, make the choices for the literal
boxes to check for focus areas in the submission process, and execute the
submission early next week, hopefully by COB Tuesday August 8. Andrew is taking
the lead on this, and the plan is to use the Slack for coordination.

Minor editorial issues include the fact that democratization is in the title
but is not mentioned in the text. This is perhaps OK, but again, suggests
another editing pass is warranted.

### SC23 BoF

No news.

### ACCESS activity (JetStream2)

We have an allocation, but we're not sure what happens next. It's not obvious
what kind of interconnect is available -- the documentation is unclear with
respect to scope, there's a white paper and so forth.

1 ACCESS Service Unit equals one vCPU core-hour, or one-quarter vGPU core-hour
(roughly).
[It depends on the specific resource.](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/general/vmsizes/#example-of-su-estimation)

The links in the notification e-mails don't answer these questions. Alan
reports that he has ACCESS credentials, but when he went to the dashboard to
try to log in, it said he didn't have access. Maybe we don't have a project?

Mike Renfro was the actual requestor for the resources, it's possible he's
gotten different or better e-mail communications than the rest of us?

#### ACCESS/JetStream2 Workshop ~~this month?~~ late September

A good goal would be to run a workshop on the Jetstream2 cloud resource, by
standing up a cluster with the MagicCastle thing. Annajiat has some learners
who could attend a workshop if we can set it up this month. This is tricky:
it's vacation season, and there's a familiarization step to execute. Late
September might be better -- that's another window where there might be some
learners available.

### Other SC23 Activities?

There's a [US RSE][usrse23] activity that might be relevant to us. Abstract
deadline is Aug. 11, and it's a lightning talk, so the expected level of effort
required is low.

### Workflow Lesson

The previously-open
[PR](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows/pull/5) has been
merged. Andrew walked us through the Snakefiles he has been building to match
the narrative of the lesson - coming soon to the repository! Noticed that
Snakemake clobbers output files when it runs, which means appending to output
file will not work.

## 17:00 EDT Session

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him), ODU

### ACCESS activity (JetStream2)

- Idea: Set up the "MagicCastle" cluster (setup identical to what Alan
  currently put on the current "HPC Carpentry cluster").

- Idea: How about using one of the work/coordination session to set up the
  Jetstream2-based cluster so we (committee) can see how this is being set up.

(Somewhat tangential) thought: in the future, we can extend the HPC Carpentry
lesson program ecosystem to include introductory lessons for sysadmin wannabes.
Catch: HPC (or Linux) sys administration is a deep expertise; so Carpentries
style learning may or may not be suitable for this training. However: There is
need to create pipeline for people skilled in HPC admin skills to meet the need
of academic HPC centers. If we can let the prerequisite high (e.g. the person
needs to be well-versed in UNIX skills (beyond what SwC's "Unix Shell" lesson
can provide), then there _could_ be a place for Carpentries-style intro to HPC
sys administration, cluster building, etc. for people with sufficient
background skills, e.g. Linux sys admin, scripting, etc.? An example target
audience would be: computationally competent researchers who was drawn to doing
system administration work at an HPC center; or a highly skilled grad students
who starts an internship work to administrate a small cluster.

Problem for system administration training is similar to many of the problems
that plague "research computing" to begin with: In formal college programs,
there is no room to fit in additional classes in their curricula. This
circumstance is prevailing everywhere, and this was the impetus for the
Carpentries-style training, i.e. to offer workshops to meet these need to train
people with the skills that could not be fit into formal courses.

### HPC Carpentry Anecdotes

Wirawan spoke to research computing staff at George Mason University, turned
out they are using parts and pieces of HPC Carpentry for a course! (Contacts at
GMU: Jayshree Sarma, director; Swabir Silayi, computational scientist /
research computing facilitator.) One feedback: They are using "HPC-Python"
lesson -- the Snakemake part seems to be out of place.
