# HPC Carpentry Meeting Minutes

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third
Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate
coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the
least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica
and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- 13:00 CET &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia, and
  Europe
- 17:00 EST &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], better for the Americas and
  Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app. In addition, the
meetings (and cancelations) are announced on the [discuss-hpc TopicBox
channel][discuss-hpc].
