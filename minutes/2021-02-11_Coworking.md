# HPCC Coworking Hours: 11 February 2021

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours every other Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. Check your local times below, and join whichever is most 
convenient. See you soon!

#### Check your local times

These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six
non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient 😉

* [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
* [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Australia

### Video Venue: -redacted-


[Jitsi -redacted URL-] is preferred. Slack is not friendly to screen reader apps, and Google Meet requires an authorized user to let people in.
