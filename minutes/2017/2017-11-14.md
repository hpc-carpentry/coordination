## Goals of session

As more and more research comes to depend on the use of high performance
computing to progress, there is a clear need to equip researchers with the
basic, practical skills so they can exploit HPC resources in an effective way.
These skills are particularly important for people just getting started with
high throughput and high performance computing, as they make researchers more
effective and make the most efficient use of resources. Given the success of
the Carpentry series in equipping researchers with the basic, practical skills
required to manage and develop their software and scripts
([Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)) and data analysis
([Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) it is natural to take the
Carpentry approach and apply it to HPC.

In this BOF we will gather input from the experts in the HPC community on the
Goals, Design, Structure and Implementation of HPC Carpentry. We aim to cover
the following topics:

- Goals
  - Who are the target audiences for HPC Carpentry?
  - What should the learning outcomes be?
- Design
  - What lessons should be included?
  - How much modularity do we want?
  - How (if any) much site/facility specific material would be needed?
- Structure
  - How long should the course last? Should we support different lengths?
  - Balance of practical, side-along training to lectures

The ideas and discussion from this BOF will be used to produce a public report
describing the key areas of development for HPC Carpentry and this will provide
the base for the development of the first version of the training. In addition,
all BOF attendees will be invited to join the HPC Carpentry discussion forum on
Google Groups to continue providing input to development of HPC Carpentry.

We plan to run the first instances of HPC Carpentry before SC'18 and will
submit a follow-on BOF to continue the community development of HPC Carpentry
by sharing experiences from the initial events.

3. Votes: 18 What is HPC Carpentry?
4. Votes: 17 What audience are you designing your curriculum for? Very
   introductory like Software Carpentry (i.e. what is git? --> what is MPI?)
5. Votes: 15 Determine best practices for HPC carpentry sessions (tools or
   resources that can be used)
6. Votes: 13 What is the current state of HPC carpentry?
7. Votes: 12 Build links with interested people to help build the most useful

### Learner profiles

In this activity, the discussion groups will design and discuss learner
profiles for HPC Carpentry courses to get an understanding of who HPC Carpentry
should be targetting and what they should learn from the course.

### Course and module design

Discussion groups will work to design an HPC Carpentry course and specify which
modules should be included to understand what formats HPC Carpentry could be
presented in and what different lessons/modules need to be included and in what
order.

### Ongoing Support and Community Integration

Groups will work to understand what ongoing support and integration is
currently available and what is missing to understand hwo we can maximise the
impact of HPC Carpentry on learners and where it fits in the wider HPC training
landscape.
