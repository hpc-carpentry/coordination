# Carpentry Con Report

Hi everyone,

Those of us who were at Carpentry Con this week had some great discussions and
work around the existing HPC-Carpentry-like curricula. Keep your inbox eyes
peeled for a full report and ways to join in the fun sometime next week. :)

Also, if you have friends and colleagues who would be interested in
test-driving materials or contributing, please encourage them to join this
list! We'd like to use this list as a primary channel to get the word out.

Cheers, Christina
