### Notes

**Summary of run workshops:**

- Martin: Univ of Leeds, 25 people attending, in general many of the same
  comments as those listed on materials may need to be done with pick as you
  need when running the workshop
- Andy:

**Discussion**

- Martin:
  - Broad spread of what people what. Materials might be part of a pick and mix
    collection. Selection and tailoring.
  - Iterating through the Carpentries like other lessons we get to learn from
    everyone else's experience.
- Christina:
  - We need to have a lot of this customization!
  - How do we make it easier to make your own putting together component pieces
    together?
- Martin:
  - Having a model workshop you can deviate from is very useful
- Peter:
  - Many people mix up putting nitty-gritty details of their cluster in the
    materials.
  - We need core concepts and then dive into site-specific stuff.
  - Put into notes so that contributors are aware of this.
- Christina:
  - Also notes for people teaching the lesson.
- Tim:
  - Has anyone tried GitHub content management system before?
    http://paislee.io/how-to-use-github-as-a-minimal-cms/
- Christina:
  - We currently add in our own layer of templating.
- Peter:
  - What's the goal?
  - We have an HPC landing website with instructions for extending it.
  - Are we going in that direction or is that dropped?
- Christina:
  - Where would you go to run a workshop? How to customize?
  - Should we have a blog? Should it be stored in a repository somewhere?
    - https://hpc-carpentry.github.io
    - https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination
- Elsa:
  - Have a master list of some repositories. A master HPC lesson that each
    organization can fork and have their own information and branding for their
    clusters. Link back with here's a list of people who have their own lessons
    that are modified you can look at.
- Andrew:
  - Show an example of a basic unmodified lesson and a customized lesson and
    make it easy to see the diff between the 2.
  - When I got into HPC carpentry, finding the official site was hard. Finally
    found it from looking for Christina's name from SciPy.
  - Hard to find the real HPC carpentry.
  - Needs fixing.
- Christina:
  - Put in the notes when you google what shows up.
- Pariksheet:
  - I get the correct first link https://hpc-carpentry.github.io when searching
    for "HPC carpentry" with DuckDuckGo
- Christina:

  - (Responding to Richard) Customization could occur at a lot of levels.
  - As much as possible should be site specific.
  - Content changes should be fed back to the template.
  - HPC Carpentry is not a formal organization so it's hard to say how people
    get involved.
  - Like the carpentry lessons there are markdown files which get edited to
    make the website.
  - We need maintainers! If that sounds interesting to you, please follow up.
  - Let's take a quick glance at the lessons to see where people are interested
    in getting involved and what they would like to do.
  - Things we would like to see or prioritize. "If we have this, that would be
    great!"

- Peter: HPC-Intro is in a transition state right now. A story has been
  started, but stops abruptly after Lesson 2/3.
  - In need of review and feedback! Personal investment in moving it forward,
    hopes to get more investment to get it stable & polished over the next few
    months (Q1-2019).
  - We need a reasonable, stable version of HPC-Intro for people to fly around
    on the cluster. https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro
- Christina:
  - HPC-Intro and shell are the most active at being reshaped and tweaked.
- Bob:
  - Thanks Peter for adding that! I spoke with our research computing group
    about using the materials. We plan to use in February or May of this year.
  - Talked with Christina and a few others with the cognitive jump from not
    doing batch work to batch jobs.
  - Having a road map would be helpful to see where the end point of the lesson
    are. What are the objective and commands being taught?
  - For example, I'm not sure I want to teach how to teach people who to ssh
    into a compute node and teach them to use the kill command; on a roadmap we
    would discuss whether that is really an appropriate thing to teach.
  - We should talk about what is etiquette on an HPC system. Would mean slowing
    things down a little bit, but for a core group of people would allow the
    community to make major changes to some of the lessons.
  - Thanks for explaining the Intro and shell lessons are still in transition.
- Tim:
  - I'm curious about the scope of HPC carpentry. Currently there's how to
    login to a node, sbatch commands, PBS. Chapel on the other hand is very
    specific beyond the core fundamentals of using an HPC system.
- Alex:
  - The original goal behind HPC carpentry was having it modular so everyone
    can contribute. We went to Chapel for many reasons; it's high level and
    supports distributed and shared memory. Much more high level. If you need
    an MPI module, feel free to develop it. We pick up what we want. The
    original goal was to have a choice between HPC python and HPC chapel. There
    are other things people do that are unpublished.
- Christina:
  - The curriculum is meant to be modular. Like an HDF5 lesson. Adding in
    lessons is a lot of work!
  - We teach at least HPC-intro and HPC-shell. The target audience might not
    need any of that extra stuff.
  - People who can no longer run on their own computer and have to use the
    cluster is our learner profile.
  - They would leave having practiced submitting a job and have an idea of the
    terms to solve a problem or understand the admin e-mails.
- Peter:
  - I see the point that there needs to be a roadmap. A steering committee
    might be a good idea.
  - Focusing on HPC-intro.
  - There is a high interest from different groups, but interest has a curve
    downwards. People don't have time. Discussions on GitHub take a long time,
    but they are very fruitful.
  - Outline:
    https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro/blob/gh-pages/lesson-outline.md
- Bob:
  - Steering committee not a bad idea of a core group deciding together what
    directions to take the lessons in.
  - This way we don't see the lessons going down one very specific path of a
    particular discipline or way that technologists use the cluster. Should be
    broadly usable by as many sites as possible.
- Christina:
  - We have a lesson outline! If people have strong feels or opinions about the
    direction of the lessons and discuss amongst themselves. Most of the
    maintainers know what we are trying to accomplish and are going to focus on
    that material. Having community feedback is important. The easiest way to
    do that would be to follow the repositories you care about and we can use
    these calls to follow up on things that need major discussion.
- Bob:
  - Making sure things map from the outline to the lesson modules and have
    regular check-ins on it.
  - I'm afraid of using mailing lists and GitHub repos can be asynchronous of
    people wanting to make decisions and waiting for replies.
- Christina:
  - We need to eliminate confusing entry points from HPC and say where to get
    started.
  - HPC-intro maintainers and interested folks should plan a meeting in the new
    year.
  - For new maintainers someone will be in touch about adding you to the GitHub
    organization.
- Peter:
  - If there's anything you want to share, use the mailing list, open issues!
- Christina:
  - Sometimes replies are slow but everyone is doing the best they can! Keep
    inching forward. Will issue a call for January.
