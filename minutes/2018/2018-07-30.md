# SIGHPC Webinar: HPC Carpentry

There has been a lot of activity recently around setting up a novice Software
Carpentry lesson around equipping researchers with the tools they need to use
computing resources beyond their laptop. In this webinar Andrew Turner from the
UK national supercomputing service will describe the current status of HPC
Carpentry development, where you can find the latest material, how you can get
involved, and what the plans for the future are.
