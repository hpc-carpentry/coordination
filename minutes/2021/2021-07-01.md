#### Check your local times

These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six
non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are
invited to join whichever is most convenient ðŸ˜‰

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

### Virtual Venue

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _Name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Benson Muite
- Alan O'Cais
- Trevor Keller, NIST
- Annajiat Alim Rasel

### Agenda & Minutes

- How did the chat with potential Norwegian sites go?
  - [name=Alan]: Well. They have an existing lesson stack, written in
    reStructuredText (rst). Not templated like ours, but they say it's "not
    hard" to reconfigure for specific sites. See
    https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/#tutorials for full list of tutorials

#### Clarification of Carpentries Affiliation

The Carpentries have requested (via Toby) that on our website, we clarify that
we are not officially affiliated. E.g., put a blurb about ourselves in certain
menu items that currently directly link over to The Carpentries.

> Some of this you can get around by removing the links/menu items altogether.
> Some of it by adjusting the context of the links. For example, it is good to
> point towards The Carpentries Code of Conduct, but you probably need to add
> some information about how Code of Conduct violations will be handled within
> HPC Carpentry. e.g. I am not sure our CoC Committee would be ready to handle
> reports coming from activity on one of your repositories (with the exception
> of lesson repositories that have been moved into the Incubator).

- Footer
  - About Us: revise to explicitly state that we're _in the spirit of The
    Carpentries_, but not official subjects yet.
  - Code of Conduct stuff: tell folks to contact a Steering Committee member to
    report a breach.
  - Privacy policy: landing pad that directs privacy inquiries to the Steering
    Committee, but otherwise has a link to The Carpentries' policy.
- Main page: replace logos & links to other Carpentries & newsletter with
  details on the Slack channel
- Menu Items

  - Learn
    - Workshops: replace straight link with a page of our own, borrowed but not
      a straight duplicate. Start keeping a YAML or JSON list of workshops
      (date, location, principals).
      - In addition to pre- and post-workshop surveys, creating a long-term (3
        months on) survey would be cool.
  - Teach: entire menu links to, or duplicates verbatim, Carpentries pages.
  - About Us
    - Values: Create an intro about HPC Carpentry, then discuss the Nine Core
      Values.
    - Task Forces: Add something about the HPC Intro task force.
    - Testimonials: I think we have some, maybe add?
    - Code of Conduct is a hot link.

- Maybe helpful https://formcarry.com/

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _Name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto

### Agenda & Minutes

Wrangling the website <https://www.hpc-carpentry.org> to reduce the appearance
that HPC Carpentry is under The Carpentries umbrella already.

Some open issues on the repo
<https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io>

- Working on issue [#38]() Contact page to contain list of members of steering
  committee

  - redirect "Who we are" in <https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/> to this contact
    page

  Did a preliminary version of this, it was ~~PR#38~~ merged on the web-page
  repo.

- ?? Do we want to mention we are in the process of

> #### OOT: Jekyll config file
>
> This can be specified multiple times--values in the latter config overriding
> those defined in the former. Idea: How about using this to specify members of
> steering committee on a separate file.

> #### OOT: Purging large files from hpc-carpentry.github.io repo
>
> Currently the .git repo is sized at 300 MB, some old files that no longer
> exist
