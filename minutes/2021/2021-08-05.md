# HPCC Coworking Hours: 5 August 2021

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. Check your local times below, and join whichever is most
convenient. A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events,
available [online][gcal] or as an [ical file][ical].

See you soon!

#### Check your local times

These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six
non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are
invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

### Virtual Venue

Both meetings will use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/gez-aeui-jdx).

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- _Name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST

### Agenda & Minutes

#### Review Feedback on SC21 BOF Proposal

[NB Schedule confusion: I (Andrew) am on-line at 1100 UTC, but noticed after a
while that while the shared calendar has this slot at 1100 UTC, this Codi has
the session listed at 1200 UTC. Addendum: If you click on the "12:00" UTC link
above, it takes you to a timeanddate-dot-com site for 11:00 UTC.]

- [name=Trevor:] Quite right! Per our shared calendar (and consensus), the
  correct time is 11:00 UTC. Fixed, and apologies for the confusion.

The rendered current draft is
[here](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/blob/conferences-directory/conferences/SC21/bof_draft.md)

The proposal has gotten some recent attention, and some feedback from Christina
Koch, who wanted to clarify the intended audience, having correctly noted some
of the muddiness of our scope issues. There's some tension between the SC21
audience, who are probably future workshop organizers solving their HPC
on-boarding problem, and the lesson audience, who are HPC novices doing the
on-boarding. One of the bullets was edited to reflect these audiences.

(Christina was explicitly pinged for feedback based on her prior participation
in HPC Carpentry BoFs at SC.)

A currently-missing item is e-mail, affiliation, and bio data for the workshop
hosts. On the SC21 submission form, e-mail and affiliation are required fields,
but the bio is not, but I think having a bio sketch motivating particpiation in
HPC carpentry has to help.

Something like, "<name> operates a cluster at <affiliation>, and has experience
bringing novice users to HPC, and is looking to streamline this process." That
would be for me, others may be similar.

Sent a "direct" slack message to the presenters asking for info for some of the
required fields -- besides e-mail and affiliation, there is also a "willing to
attend in person if possible" yes/no question, and a "willing to present
virtually if required" yes/no question for all the hosts.

Added a question to the bof draft about how to use outside material.

## Later Meeting (Americas and Oceania)

### Participants

- _Name (pronouns), affiliation_
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Benson Muite

### Agenda & Minutes

#### Review Feedback on SC21 BOF Proposal

Some modifications to the BoF proposal throughout the day, including formatting
for bio blurbs. Hopefully Alan and Annajiat can get some blurbs in in the next
day or so, but we can also proceed without if necessary.

Benson is working on some PRs, and also still plans to adapt some of the
material from the heterogenous computing workshop. ETA for feedback from that
workshop is maybe close to real-time. The workshop is in a week and a half or
so (from Aug. 5).

workshop with similar coverage, but different timing.
