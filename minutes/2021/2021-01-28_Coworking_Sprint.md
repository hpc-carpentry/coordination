## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

During this two-hour sprint, we will go through the open issues and PRs on
[hpc-intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro), triaging and
assigning appropriate labels. The goal at the end of the day is to have a set
of actionable issues and pull requests, so we can focus our efforts.

### Participants

- Toby Hodges (I will join for the start and try to stay as long as possible
  but might struggle to commit two full hours)
- Benson Muite
- Apologies from Alan, organising the
  [EasyBuild User Meeting](https://easybuild.io/eum/) and
  [speaking on LearnHPC](https://easybuild.io/eum/#learnhpc) at 11am UTC
- Andrew Reid, NIST

### Notes

- Catch the
  [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyDHzxlwJUw&list=PLhnGtSmEGEQh0pCtmkFQsDzeoo6tbYnyZ&index=20)
  of Alan's talk at
  [11:00 to 11:15 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210128T1100&msg=LearnHPC+Alan+YouTube)!
- Consider having lessons for example applications such as Fire Dynamics
  Simulator https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/, OOF2
  https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/
- [#7](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/7), add
  learner profiles -- this is a good idea, but needs some context, like a
  better-titled subsection. The advantage is that learners can see themselves
  in the profiles, to help motiviate participation in the lesson.
  - Trevor: This issue proposes adding three user profiles. Peter suggested
    three blurbs, and I committed revised versions some time ago. The
    discussion of revisions, while useful, is out of scope, as the Issue has
    been resolved.
- [#9](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/9), episode
  renumbering -- this is superseded by
  [#230](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/230). Closed
  with a comment to that effect.
- [#228](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/228), add
  this to the Carpentry "help wanted" -- now that we are Carpentries-hosted, we
  can do this, but maybe wait for the clean-up of legacy issues first to reduce
  confusion among new-comers to the repo.
  - Useful info from Toby: The "help wanted" page only lists issues with the
    "help wanted" tag, broken out by repo, so the danger of confusion is
    reduced compared to a novice hitting the full repo.
- [#14](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/14), define
  "job" -- identified a good location for this, concur that this should happen.
  - Trevor added Help Wanted and Good First Issue labels.
- [#15](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/15), "Why" of
  a cluster is missing -- possibly addressed? The "Why use a cluster" lesson
  covers scenarios where scaling up is needed and a cluster does this.
  - Trevor: Christina addressed this in
    [#17](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/pull/17), adding
    motivation at the start. This issue is resolved.
- [#18](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/18),
  distinguish between `-n` and `-N` in Slurm. Queuing system variants are
  covered by the new snippets scheme, and the lesson already uses `-n` and `-N`
  differently. Verify other queuing system snippets work correctly, and close.
  - Trevor: This is a Slurm specific thing, and the snippet mechanism works.
    The issue is resolved.
- [#21](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/21), use GNU
  parallel. Added a link to an existing lesson that uses this as potential
  useful input. Maybe in a different scope, like a shell-centric lesson? The
  step up from serial shell to GNU parallel is much lower than going straight
  to MPI.
  - This issue triggered a very broad discussion on the appropriate scope and
    the problems surrounding parallelism. On the one hand, MPI is ubiquitous in
    cluster computing, and is a very high value target to reach in an HPC-intro
    lesson, which maybe the only HPC lesson a learner ever encounters, so it
    would be a dis-service to these learners not to get to MPI. The
    complications of C compilation and the opaqueness of the cpi example code
    are liabilities, but there is a Python MPI example under consideration. The
    counterpoint is that MPI is hard to understand and "magic" in a bad way,
    and GNU parallel introduces the parallelism that is relevant to achieving
    performance increases. In this second view, MPI content could be deferred
    to a second lesson, where there would be sufficient time to introduce the
    necessary background, so it can be omitted form hpc-intro.
  - This is related to the issue of requiring and building on the shell-intro
    lesson, rather than having a separate hpc-shell lesson. There could then be
    two HPC lessons, hpc-intro and hpc-advanced, with MPI in the latter
    section.
  - There are lots of parallel programming models, and there is content out
    there we can use as a resource for a secondary lesson, e.g. Chapel,
    [UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov/docs/html/guide.html),
    [Legion](https://legion.stanford.edu/) and other Parallel Global Address
    Space (PGAS) models, so fleshing out an "advanced" lesson is possible.
  - [OpenOnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) gives a workflow that is
    accessible to many users
  - Trevor: parallel is about throughput much more than performance, and
    therefore falls out of scope. Recommend focusing our efforts on MPI with C
    and Python; applied the "wontfix" label.
  - Taking Benson's point, HPC is broader than PDE solvers, and we should
    expose learners to a bunch of different paradigms. True, but this issue
    remains out of scope for hpc-intro.
- [#22](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/22), weave a
  narrative. These can be helpful to maintain engagement and reinforce the
  concept of why we're doing any of this. Enhancement / final polish, not
  structural _per se_, but definitely worth doing.

## Later Meeting (Americas & Australia)

During this sprint, we will go through the open issues and PRs on
[hpc-intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro), triaging and
assigning appropriate labels. The goal at the end of the day is to have a set
of actionable issues and pull requests, so we can focus our efforts.

### Participants

- Trevor Keller (he/they)
- Wirawan Purwanto (he/him)
- Andrew Reid (he/him)

### Notes

- See inline comments on the Earlier Meeting notes above.
- [#24](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-intro/issues/24),
  maintainer sets. Out of scope for an individual lesson; migrated (by brute
  copy-paste) to
  [coordination#32](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/32)

- [#154](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/154) The fastq
  files was not found anywhere

  - How to solve: transfer fastqc (bash-lesson.tar.gz) from learner's local
    machine to the cluster
  - Challenge with fastqc example: not all clusters have it. Many learners do
    not understand what's fastqc is and what it is for. Or not in ther interest
    area.
  - How to get around: (1) have a quick install script to make fastqc on a
    site; or (2) instead of using fastqc, use Nelle Nemo's processing bash
    script from shell-novice lesson.
  - **TK's recommendation for [#154]**: close this issue; open another issue
    for removing "fastqc" from the lesson, introduce mpi4py "pi" example and
    spend more time with it to teach [parallelism and how to run parallel jobs
    with MPI].

- On the introduction of MPI in the hpc-intro lesson: Is teaching MPI is a must
  for new learners? Why or why not?

  - Andrew: "something involving MPI is necessary. It's a disservice to our
    learners _not_ to expose them to MPI." Python Pi example is the preferred
    venue.
    - The jump from serial to MPI jobs is too great.
    - GNU parallel would be a stepping stone: serial to high throughput to MPI
    - flip side: GNU parallel is awkward to use
  - The con of MPI lesson:
    - too much black magic (parts not explained, large jump in concept)
  - MPI and "GNU Parallel" represent two ends of the spectrum of parallel
    computing: tightly vs loosely coupled problems
  - Reflecting the mission of Carpentries: to teach people an understanding of
    "what's going on under the hood". The C example of MPI is too much "magic"
    -- too much blackbox. But because MPI is ubiquituous in HPC everywhere--the
    "magic" involved in the MPI hands-on does not negate the importance of
    teaching users about MPI
    - many users use MPI "under the hood" without realizing it
    - Carpentries lessons are not only providing the minimum they need to
      function, but also to encourage them to grow
  - The reason of using a HPC cluster is to use parallelism. So not to teach
    parallelism is not right.
  - Mark Piercy: "20% of users use MPI, but they use cluster a lot"
  - The mpi4py "pi" example is a good teaching tool, the computation of "pi"
    being familiar to virtually everyone

- What important elements of MPI that new users need to be exposed to?

  - job arrays => running in different locations
  - data transport issues arising in MPI

- How long does "hpc-intro" lesson runs for in a real workshop? If we have more
  time, we can insert more advanced programming paradigms such as shared
  memory, task-based parallelism, ...
  - The design length was 4 hr
  - This determines also how deeper topic such as MPI will be covered
  - _Discussion_: What is first order and what is second order? For HPC,
    teaching the concept of "connecting to a remote machine and do work with
    that" is first order, whereas leveraging parallelism on that platform will
    be second order.
