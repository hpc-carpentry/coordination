# October 7, 2021 HPC Carpentry Coworking Hours

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.
