#### Check your local times

These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six
non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are
invited to join whichever is most convenient ðŸ˜‰

- [12:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Australia

### Video Venue: -redacted-

[Jitsi -redacted URL-] is preferred. Slack is not friendly to screen reader
apps, and Google Meet requires an authorized user to let people in.
