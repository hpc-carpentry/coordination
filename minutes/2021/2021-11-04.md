# HPCC Coworking Hours: 4 November 2021

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

## Earlier Meeting (Africa, Asia, and Europe)

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Benson Muite

### Agenda with Minutes

> For the sake of clarity, please take notes _directly inline_ with the agenda,
> rather than in a separate section. Thanks!

#### End of Daylight Saving Time

- [name=Trevor]: 1200 UTC would be a lot better for me.
- [name=Benson]: 1200 UTC works,

#### SC BoF

- [name=Andrew] pinged the organizers, switched back to Hybrid, as it was.
  Optimistic that St. Louis is not a ghost town.

#### Workshop Feedback

- [name=Benson]: Some feedback: spreading things out a bit (splitting things
  up) would be good---more modularity. Some facilities want users to learn more
  about parallel filesystems (theirs), which might not be applicable to
  everyone. Likewise, principles of parallel programming, HPC workflows,
  containers, advanced queuing topics (job arrays), ...

- [name=Trevor]: request from our learners is a presentation to kick-off,
  nailing down vocabulary (node vs. server, partition vs. queue)
  - [name=Benson]: consider a Library Carpentry-style jargon-busting icebreaker
    to promote engagement
  - [name=Andrew]: our users may never have heard these terms, so a _quick_
    slideshow introducing vocabulary would be good.
- [name=Andrew]: Writing out the Python `pi.py` script was not the best use of
  time: desire muscle memory for scheduler commands, not Python _per se_.
  - Download the serial script, then launch a job with it as directed
  - Talk through what the job script means as it runs
  - Collectively upgrade the serial code with MPI calls
- [name=Trevor]: We tanked our login node when users launched `pi.py` with
  large _n_; ran out of memory. A gray-box script means we could write in some
  bounds-checking code

#### _much ado about longitude_
