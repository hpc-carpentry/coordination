## Agenda

[previous coordination CodiMD](https://codimd.carpentries.org/UrB52XMsTMe_eOypGPqoJw).
For general process info, see also the
[accepted process proposal](https://codimd.carpentries.org/3VbpZ4C5T5eLD9V_0ZJGng).

### State of the Lessons

- Benson Muite taught some of our material, and had a very welcome feedback
  thread in the HPC Carpentries
  [Slack](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T/p1630586431001000?thread_ts=1630519991.000700&cid=CEXAZR52T).
  Can any of these be translated into actionable issues on the lessons? Have
  any of them?

### SC21

- The
  [SC21 submissions page](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/submit/submission-deadlines/)
  says that BoF proposal notifications will be sent Sept. 10, 2021, but nothing
  has been received so far (as of Sept. 13, 2021), and logging in and querying
  the "reviews" on the submission page yields a message that reviews will be
  available on or about 11:59pm UTC-12 Sept. 17, 2021. Possibly reviews have
  been delayed.
- The SC21 organizers seem to be slowly coming around to the idea of a more
  virtual event, but their
  [Remote Participation FAQ](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/attend/remote-participation-faq/)
  makes it clear that only "selected" sessions (TBD as of this writing, Sept.
  13 2021) will be live-streamed on the app.
- There is a
  [proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/72) on the
  coordination repo about hosting remote participation for BoF attendees
  ourselves.

### CarpentryCon

- There's an [issue](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/74)
  on the repo where opinions may be shared on how to prepare for
  CarpentryCon 2021.

### Site Logistics

- There are a number of proposals on the
  [coordination repo](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproposal)
  which fall into the "state of the sites" category. - There is a
  [proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/71) set up
  long-lived hosting for workshop materials on behalf of organizers.
  https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T/p1631057210006400 - There is
  a formal [proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/70)
  to resolve the issue about what to do with HPC-Shell. - We have had some
  discussion about registering workshops with the website. Did the
  [recent lesson](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T/p1631057210006400)
  do this? What were the barriers? Also, the question was actually about a
  standard feedback form -- should we have this?

#### State of the Sites

Some of our community has some experience teaching the material.

Problem with connection logistics and standing up a cluster. The content should
work for both formal workshops and individuals who are self-learning.

Need a clear guide for setup.

- [name=Alan]: When you sign up for AWS you get an allotment that you must
  "spend" within a year
- [name=Annajiat]: Major hurdle to using AWS is that learners need their own
  accounts, and signing up requires a credit card, which many do not have.
- [name=Benson]: In principle, the lesson can be taught on 4 cores, with
  minimal compute requirements. Slurm on 2 cores, and 2 separate compute cores.
- [name=Annajiat]: With a good enough machine, the host can make a virtual
  cluster.
  - [name=Alan]: has a guide for setting up a container-based virtual cluster,
    using Anaconda/Conda. No shared filesystem (yet!), but we can make it work.
    Also no software stack.
    - Slurm only
    - https://github.com/E-CAM/jobqueue_features#tutorial-configuration
    - https://github.com/E-CAM/jobqueue_features/tree/master/tutorial
  - [name=Annajiat]: If it's significantly lighter than MagicCastle, that's a
    plus.

Also, file transfer was an issue -- some learners in institutional settings
were not able to execute file transfers, due to IT security constraints like
proxies. Uploading files to the cluster failed for these learners, which breaks
the workflow.

These concerns highlight a flaw in our assumptions: the lessons are written
under the assumption that a cluster exists, and learners are there to get
started. This may well be false, with no cluster in place at all.

There are various resources along these lines. XSEDE apparently has a "cluster
in a suitcase" solution, it's a $20K box that you can transport to a site for
training. Some learners set up Raspberry Pi clusters to get started. Probably
both of these are more expensive than a cloud solution.

Broken model of our learners, in the best way! Learners have very broad access
to instructions that they can follow without understanding, allowing them to
execute complex technical tasks like cluster set-up, but without a solid
conceptual understanding of what's going on. Their solutions are likely
inflexible. For learners in this category, what we add in terms of value is
conceptual depth. The lessons need to accommodate these configurations, and
maybe link to or provide instructions for set-up to broaden our audience to
include this group.

Learners have varying backgrounds, and may not know e.g. Python. Broader
prerequisites, or narrow scope of the lessons, would help.

Also possibly valuable is lesson content about how to recover from common
errors in jobs. The git lesson does this, it has a unit about re-initializing a
repo. Suppose e.g. you have multiple jobs running, and get confused about which
output you're looking at (because they're indistinguishable numbers), and you
cancel the wrong one.

#### BOF

No word yet. SC21 is meandering towards hybrid, but the
[FAQ](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/attend/remote-participation-faq/) states
only "select" BOFs will be hybrid.

Proposal: [hybrid BOF](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/72)

Another option is to just make our BoF purely virtual, and use the SC21 time
slot for it.

Another alternative is to have two events (much like our regular Thursday
meetings),

The SC value-add is people dropping in: _free marketing._ For the virtual
component, we can put some effort ourselves into marketing and drumming up
interest.

#### CarpentryCon

Proposal:
[submit a session proposal](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/74)

#### Site Logistics

- Proposal:
  [Long-lived hosting](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/71)

  - Institutional GitHub orgs won't commit to storing Carpentries workshop
    repos long-term.
  - There was some discussion about this in the Sept. 2 co-working, including
    suggestions about the right scope for what should be in a project. We can
    host forks of repors that are customized for particular sites, to save
    future workshops the hassle of rebuilding/retemplating, but a separate site
    for each individual lesson would be a lot of sites, which would likely be
    hard to navigate.
  - [name=Alan] There is new lesson infrastructure being developed by the
    Carpentries, which might simplify this operation.
  - [name=Alan] We could also have static sites for different schedulers,
    rather than just the single default that we have now.
  - [name=Trevor] The Google form asks people if they need help with set-up,
    and the advantage of customization for a particular repo is not small.
  - [name=Alan] What about capturing valuable changes?
  - [name=Andrew] Templating makes this work well, people with changes can do a
    PR, and the base site will get their templates (harmless) and their changes
    (good!).
  - [name=Trevor] It's not quite that straightforward, the templating operation
    involves copying a top-level config file over, which changes the default,
    which induces a certain merge conflict.
  - Logistical question: Same or separate organization? Probably we want a
    separate organization, to accommodate the GitHub forking workflow. A
    secondary advantage of this is that the templating works better in this
    scheme.

- Proposal:
  [streamline hpc-shell](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/70)

- Workshop registration and feedback forms -- there has been some discussion
  historically in the slack, probably a few months ago, but no action.
- [name=Alan] Reasonable way forward is to start with something simple (link
  the form we _have_), collect feedback, and make changes going forward.
  - See https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T/p1626419006080700

#### Other Business

There's an issue on the HPC-Python repo about its scope and relationship to the
HPC Incubator SnakeMake lesson. HPC-Python is mostly about Snakemake workflow,
and does a poor job of presenting Python, and does so primarily as a means to
access SnakeMake. HPC-Python should perhaps be absorbed into SnakeMake, or vice
versa? We can add value with our templating scheme. What is certain is that our
HPC-Python lesson is badly out of date.
