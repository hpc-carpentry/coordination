# HPCC Coworking Hours: 2 September 2021

The HPC Carpentries Task Force holds coworking hours on the first Thursday,
with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global
constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for
the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station
are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

- [11:00 UTC][earlier] &mdash; better for Africa, Asia, and Europe
- [22:00 UTC][evening] &mdash; better for the Americas and Oceania

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available
[online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

#### Review Proposals from [**<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> coordination**][proposals]

- [name=Wirawan]: Shell lesson prerequisite for HPC-intro lesson?
  ([#70](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/70))

  - [name=Andrew] put a commment on this issue reflecting two possible
    strategies to move forward in the event we decide we want the Unix Shell
    lesson as a prerequisite. There is shell material we need to cover. It
    could be in a separate, much reduced "HPC-Shell" lesson, or it could be
    incorporated directly into HPC-Intro.
  - [name=Trevor] added "temperature check" comments: please weigh in on your
    preference for the two options presented. Do we keep HPC Shell as a
    single-unit shim, or subsume it entirely under HPC Intro?

- [name=Trevor]: "HPC Workshops" organization to host materials indefinitely
  ([#71](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/71))

  - Brief discussion clarified that this would be a public organization, and
    under current GitHub terms of service, there's no cost for this. There
    would be some maintenance required to manage which users have write
    permissions to which repositories in the organization.
  - We could set this up as an organization on a separate git-repo hosting
    platform, e.g. GitLab.
  - [name=Toby] Once a site-specific repo is created, does it need to be
    regenerated? I.e. do you need the date of the workshop to be included in
    the name of the repository?
  - Related issues:
    - It may make more sense to have "per-cluster" repositories in this GitHub
      organization, rather than for each cluster and session. The latter scheme
      would lead to a proliferation of repos and complicate management.
    - In the future, there may be Carpentries-run sessions using some
      yet-to-be-determined but probably cloud-based cluster infrastructure. A
      repo with this material in it could be one of the repos here, simplifying
      the workload for the Carpentries folks, who have a harder scaling problem
      than we do.
    - For the case of cloud or sandbox instructional clusters, the lifetime of
      the HPC resource may be much shorter than the lifetime of the repo. This
      isn't necessarily bad.

  * [name=Toby] [staticman](https://staticman.net) could probably used to take
    form input and generate a site with the proper templating pre-filled.

- [name=Trevor]: Plan for virtual SC'21 BoF
  ([#72](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/72))
  - How to request support for virtual sessions? To whom should this request be
    addressed?
  - We have not seen many attempts at a hybrid meeting, and it's difficult to
    pull off the sense of camaraderie of sitting in the same room.
  - It takes enormous discipline to keep the online participants looped in.

#### Discuss Issues from [**<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> coordination**][coordination-issues]

- [Linking to relevant existing lessons, #63](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/63)

  - Where would these links actually go?
    - The Website (comprehensive list)
    - Extras on lessons (subset)
  - [name=Andrew] opened
    [hpc-carpentry.github.io/47](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/47)

- [feedback surveys, #26](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/26)

  - Partially reused or reimplemented on the website
  - [name=Trevor] added [name=Andrew], [name=Annajiat], and [name=Wirawan] as
    collaborators on the workshop form
  - How does data from the form get turned into entries on the website? Need to
    ping [name=Alan].

- [hpc-carpentry vision, #13](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/13)

  - [name=Andrew]: Obviously related to
    [audience selection, #54](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/54)
  - [name=Andrew]: primary value of this issue is in the links. Discussion of
    audience selection/scope/features is ongoing, robust, and far from settled.

- [splitting hpc-python, #14](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/14)
  - There's a good snakemake lesson in the incubator.
  - hpc-parallel-novice gets a lot more use and covers the interesting basics
    of python
  - [name=Trevor] transferred from **coordination** into **hpc-python**
