# HPCC Meeting, March 20, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

1. Workbench development (hpc-intro) needs a point person.
2. ACCESS allocation
3. PEARC deadline? (We intend to submit an abstract.)
4. Workshops: NERSC/LLNL? Anybody have one upcoming? [Put it on the website!](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/upcoming-workshops/)
5. 

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

By the time of this meeting, the March 5 development activity will be complete, and we'll have a clear idea where we stand. We probably still need a point person, or maybe another co-working session?

As of the time of this writing, it looks like Jean Chang's fork of Toby's flattened [HPC Intro](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) is in pretty good shape, it builds, and can fill in variables from the R runtime environment that have been populated by a config file, following the EPCC model.  

It remains relevant that [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

#### History

Jean's fork of Toby's flattened [HPC Intro](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) can be found at https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake.  

There are three instances of the Scheduler episode. In the [original](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-scheduler.md)), the flattened snippet looks like ``{{ site.remote.prompt }}``. The [EPCC instance](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-epcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-epcc-scheduler.Rmd)) took the EPCC version of that episode from the EPCC repo and showed their snippet strategy worked (same snippet now has format \`r config\$remote\$prompt\`) with a slightly tweaked instance of EPCC's [yaml config](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/epcc_config.yaml). Finally, an [HPCC version](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-hpcc-scheduler.Rmd)) using the EPCC Scheduler episode content and HPCC snippets that has the values for HPCC snippets into [lesson_config.yaml](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/lesson_config.yaml). 

ToDos and decision points
1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a.  use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

The deRSE activity has now happened, we anticipate reports on this -- there has already been some slack traffic.

There was an opportunity to put in an abstract for [PASC 2025](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/about/conference/), but the deadline is March 7, probably missed?

Also from the Slack, the GW team (Clark Gaylord and Joseph Creech) have submitted a tutorial proposal for [PEARC25](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc25/).

The PEARC25 BoF proposal has a [Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/DEIOJqIGTxiElw5jCakVcw), assitance with this would be welcome, esppecially a list of recent events.


#### Actual Workshops

The NIST team got positive feedback from their abbreviated workshop, and now plan to repeat it in mid to late March at NIST's sister site in Colorado.

Andrew, Trevor, and Wirawan chatted with NERSC folks, things are looking reasonable -- they want a hybrid or virtual session with maybe 40 learners as a supplement to bring the most novice users up to speed on basic skills prior to entering their more advanced training process.  Balancing calendar holes vs value is a challenge, we will definitely loop back with them. Target date is June 2025.  

Question for Carpentries: What are the best tools for "looking over the shoulder" of virtual participants at a workshop, for detecting possible disengagement?

### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we hear anything.


#### The Website

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Marc-André Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- Dirk Ribbrock, Technical University of Dortmund, Germany
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Martin Errenst, University of Wuppertal, Germany
- Alan O'Cais, University of Barcelona, Spain

### Newcomers!

Dirk Ribbrock is interested in seeing what we are doing.

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Issues remain about how exactly (or whether) to do logic in the templates and/or snippets. Trevor has done some porting work on Alan's fork of the probable-pancake repo. Some discussion of whether this migration could be done automatically -- start with a list of the liquid templates?

There are some notes about this in the [previous meeting][last-meeting]. There were two pieces, firstly a file-system scheme where each episode would have subdirectories for the localized content, and localizaiton would involve populating these and setting a top-level config variable, and also a scheme where there would be a default config that would set all the variables that need populating, so that a custom config would only need to set the variables it cares about, which may be a lot of them, but might not be all of them.

Alan will try to capture this intention in his repo.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### deRSE feedback

The topic was identifying instructors, attendance was good, and included people from HPC centers and experts, so this was useful outreach. Also non-HPC-background attendees who were interested. Lots to follow up on. Some survey results were posted on the slack.

#### PASC 

May or may not have worked?

#### PEARC25 

Apropos of the background document for PEARC, it'd be good to summarize our recent activity.

Question about the informal certification thing at ISC24 -- this did happen, but the mapping to the skill tree has not been done, and the skill tree itself that this group was working on is still in flux, and may not be complete, e.g. it has a section on Spack but not EasyBuild in the HPC admin section.

Recent workshops: LLNL June 2024,  CECAM December 2025 NIST Feb 2025
https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/an-introduction-to-high-performance-computing-1365

### Workshops

NIST coming up in April.

Also NERSC in June of 2025, probably hybrid or remote -- question about how to detect if learners have disconnected? We may not have a good answer, we assume/hope that learners want to be there, and are motivated. You can check in with them frequenly, enough to keep them on track, but not so often that it annoys them. Dirk had a solution where learners were logged in to a central terminal server, so during windows for exercises, instructors and helpers can see who is and isn't typing. This is pretty invasive.

The December BioNT workshop, interaction was only through the shared document, so there was a need to be careful about syncrhonization points and surveying folks in the document. For the HPC part, if you have access to the slurm metadata, you can see job submission. For that one, there was an extra motivational piece because they offered a completion certificate, and they could make it clear that attempting the exercises is a requirement for getting the certificate.

### Other business?

What's up with ACCESS?

## 17:00 EST Session ([VTC][zoom_early]) -- Same room!

### Participants

- Andrew Reid
- Joseph Creech, George Washington University
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Trevor has applied the first-cut, no-snippets R-rendering mechanic to *all* the lessons in Alan's fork of the probable-pancake repo. Huge progress! There's a link to that PR and the repo in the slack channel.

<https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake/pull/2>

### Conferences and Outreach

#### PEARC'25: Tutorial on HPC (GWU-led) -- Rejected

The GW tutorial (on hpc-intro and workflow(?), proposed to PEARC'25) was rejected. Maybe the proposal was too ambitious. But they did get an ACCESS allocation, and were starting to look in to the OpenHPC recipe. Might use it for a workshop at GW and do some development with that. (There is also an internal cluster at GWU potentially for running workshop--we are still considering.) Allocation was 200K credits on JetStream 2 CPU.

Q: Can this be shared with the community?


#### PEARC'25 BOF Proposal

See the [Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/DEIOJqIGTxiElw5jCakVcw)


#### SC'25 Presentation

(Brainstorming)
What topics could we present at SC'25?

We encountered communities and efforts that we had missed priorly:

* The HPC edu/training workshop (BPHTE)
* The HPC-ED effort

We are now plugged in SIGHPCEDU community.

Potential topics to report to the community:

  * The experience of doing workshops in the past few years (2024 at LLNL, upcoming 2025 NERSC workshop [planned]). What are the lessons learned at these workshop which could shape the future of HPC-intro.

  * Report the progress of HPC Carpentry's incubation into the Carpentries.



### Engagement with NERSC

Meeting with NERSC folks, 2025-03-19.
See meeting notes here (ARCHIVED):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17iOWlM1mGuKtYMruJ9Rdhg7cAvnNC6avUqFhJplHRe0/edit

The plan to offer summer workshop at NERSC is moving forward. We were approached by them for a virtual/hybrid at-scale workshop ("Intro to NERSC HPC environment") but after talking to NERSC folks, it looks like they estimated the number of very new learners to be ~40. So it is not out of question to conduct a hybrid Carpentry-style workshop as long as sufficient helpers can be mustered.

We will meet again with the NERSC people in ~2 week.


### Workshops

GW might be doing something soon, no definite plans at this point. Maybe with the ACCESS allocation that was recently secured by GW.

Upcoming: Abbreviated "shell + hpc-intro" workshop at NIST Boulder in April.


### Other Business

#### HPC Carpentry cluster

The latest ACCESS allocation has expired (led by Mike Renfro as the PI).
* Should we renew it (if it is possible)?
* We may need to write a short final report providing closure to that allocation (expiring Dec 2024).

Some question about whether we should have a standing ACCESS allocation, so we can do workshops with low friction? The other way is to not have it standing by, and use commercial cloud resources if we need to do something on short notice, possibly with financial assistance from the Carpentries if it's well enough aligned and its available.

On the one hand, setting up cluster on AWS for a workshop costs a little (about $50?) per workshop; this could be cost prohibitive for developing countries; Carpentries might be willing to pay for that--need to ask.

On the other hand, the expertise of setting up a cluster in the cloud is still rare. We need a training to upskill some of us to provision cluster like that in an instant using the existing recipe(s) such as the MagicCastle one.
