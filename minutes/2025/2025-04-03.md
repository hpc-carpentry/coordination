# HPCC Meeting, April 3, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

1. Elections!
2. Workbench development (hpc-intro) needs a point person.
3. Lesson names
4. The Website
5. Workshops: Anybody have one upcoming? [Put it on the website!](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/upcoming-workshops/)
6. Lesson Program Incubation: how are we doing?

### Elections!

The incumbent Steering Committee has been seated far longer than 12 months. We should be deposed. Failing that, we are required to schedule an Election! Considerations:

1. When?

   "Springtime" was arbitrarily chosen, and seems easy to forget. Is there a better time?
2. How?

   We've used GitHub and (website I'm too lazy to look up right now).com in the past.
3. Who?

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Trevor replaced the Jekyll/Liquid syntax throughout Alan's fork of Toby's flattened HPC Intro lesson. It is available to [view](https://ocaisa.github.io/probable-pancake/) ([src](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake)).

The next step is to re-snippetize. If nobody else jumps at the opportunity, Trevor will create a default library for Slurm populated with generic replacements for proper nouns throughout. This can serve as the "fallback" configuration, over which site customizations may be laid. Another default for PBS/Torque, GridEngine, etc. can also be made, if there is any demand.

It remains relevant that [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

#### ToDos and decision points

1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a. use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Target Demographics

People who are not interested in parallel programming may (often?) see __HPC Intro__ and skip right past.
Might we come up with a name that better signals the course content, i.e., scheduler fundamentals?

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

Andrew drafted and submitted a PEARC25 BoF proposal (content's on [Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/DEIOJqIGTxiElw5jCakVcw)).

#### Actual Workshops

The NIST team got positive feedback from their abbreviated workshop, and now plan to repeat it in mid to late March at NIST's sister site in Colorado.

Andrew, Trevor, and Wirawan chatted with NERSC folks, things are looking reasonable -- they want a hybrid or virtual session with maybe 40 learners as a supplement to bring the most novice users up to speed on basic skills prior to entering their more advanced training process.  Balancing calendar holes vs value is a challenge, we will definitely loop back with them. Target date is June 2025.

_Question for Carpentries:_ What are the best tools for "looking over the shoulder" of virtual participants at a workshop, for detecting possible disengagement?

### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we are disappeared for mentioning DEI.

#### The Website

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_room])

### Participants

- Trevor (they/them) Keller, NIST
- Martin Errenst (he/him), University of Wuppertal
- Alan O'Cais
- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/his), RWTH Aachen University
- Benson Muite
- Annajiat Alim Rasel
- Toby Hodges (he/him/his)


### Elections?

HPC Carpentry has a "steering committee", which is a "round table" group that has authority to make decisions about and for the project. Members of the steering committee have write access to the repositories, and where there is institutional ownership of other resources (e.g. the hpc-carpentry.org domain), generally a steering-committee member has that.

Group consensus this session is that yes, we should have elections.

#### Notice of Elections

Notify folks. We have an X account, but maybe we don't want to be there. We're not sure if there is an HPC Carpentry Mastodon account. There is not now a Bluesky account, but that's easy to arrange. For newly-created accounts, we could ask the Carpentries to boost the announcement, which would help with reach. We can also reach out on the Carpentries Slack, and on HPC Social. 

We will announce a formal date and plan (this week?).

Elements of the plan: Nominations or self-nominations on Github issues, require seconding, have at least a month for people to think about it. There are nominally five positions on the steering committee.

Trevor will draft an election plan for review, based on [coordination/124](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/124).

### Workbench

Alan's [probable pancake](https://ocaisa.github.io/probable-pancake/) fork has been updated to have all the Liquid/Jekyll/Jinja stuff replaced with r-markdown interpolations, so it now renders correctly. 

The next step is to make it configurable as easily as possible. The [current configuration](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/lesson_config.yaml) is a bit of a mess.

A significant issue seems to be that the configuration variables are not self-documenting -- at the point of use, it's not obvious how a given variable fits in to the overall context, and where else it might be used in the lesson. This lack of clarity can encourage narrow scopes for variables, and correspondingly discourage re-use, which ultimately increases the maintenance burden.

Toby: Possibly we should have an expectation that the number of variables will be minimized, people should be discouraged from doing this. Maybe written guidelines, or possibly actual rules.

What if we _design_ this thing, so that the code becomes a bit more legible? On GitHub, you'll see all the raw tamplate parameter code, and it would be nice if it was "obvious" (legible, hackable) instead of obfuscated.

Special co-working meeting about this? Yes!

Toby: Don't under-rate the current system, it's pretty good at making common changes easy. Possibly what needs to happen is documenting it, and especially including comments to provide scoping guidance.

Alan: Use instructor notes? Toby: Potential blizzard of content on the notes page.

Marc-Andre: Debug mode, so you can (a) see where a variable is populated when you're using it, and (b) see where a variable is used, when you are defining it? 

### Outreach

We should set up an omni-broadcast tool to manage meeting announcements, etc., on all our comms channels at once.
For the Election, this would include Bsky, Mastodon, etc.
We have a pip channel, too, or we will when Alan configures an email for it.

Andrew will take the action item of identifying such a tool, and aggregating the credentials for the HPC Carpentry socials, creating new ones if necessary.

## 17:00 EST Session ([VTC][zoom_room])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor (they/them) Keller, NIST
- Wirawan Purwanto

### AOB

- How to keep learners up-to-speed in a hybrid/remote workshop? Asked on the `#general` channel on the slack, maybe people have good ideas.


### Expanding Outreach

Would be ideal if we can write a blog on an annual progress of HPC Carpentry. This is to provide an outlet to update our progress.

Another option is to organize a mini-symposium on a friendly venue such as CarpentryCon, consisting of HPC-carpentry presentations: what people want, compare & contrast workshop experiences (+ various HPC training efforts)---what worked and what did not work.

The fall CASC meeting will be a month or so before SC25, and we think will be in Minnesota. Maybe do an HPC Carpentry presentation to them? But they are more concerned with higher-level issues.


### Roadmap of HPCC?

It would be nice if we spell out our strategic roadmap publicly so people know where we are heading.

Currently, in terms of strategic tracks:

(1) the highest priority is to develop the "strategic track 1" (user-track) workshop programming.

(2) Next in line, the "developer track" (track 2). Example, workshop on basic parallel processing on common parallel frameworks (MPI? Dask? Chapel?). Are there people who don't know how to use shell yet need to run parallel programs?

(3) Another track of effort is indexing the HPC-related lessons out there that are very related to HPCC lessons (so that people can find "what else out there that I can use to learn/teach"). This is very similar to other efforts, such as Carpentries Incubator or HPC-ED.
