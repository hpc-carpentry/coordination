# HPCC Meeting, February 6, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 3][zoom_late], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

This item is mostly unchanged since the [last meeting][last-meeting]. 

One salient fact is [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

If there has not been recent progress, then the relevant agenda topic is how to better support this effort.

#### History

Jean has been leading the charge on this. Jean's fork of Toby's flattened [HPC Intro](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) can be found at https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake.  

There are three instances of the Scheduler episode. In the [original](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-scheduler.md)), the flattened snippet looks like ``{{ site.remote.prompt }}``. The [EPCC instance](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-epcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-epcc-scheduler.Rmd)) took the EPCC version of that episode from the EPCC repo and showed their snippet strategy worked (same snippet now has format \`r config\$remote\$prompt\`) with a slightly tweaked instance of EPCC's [yaml config](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/epcc_config.yaml). Finally, an [HPCC version](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-hpcc-scheduler.Rmd)) using the EPCC Scheduler episode content and HPCC snippets that has the values for HPCC snippets into [lesson_config.yaml](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/lesson_config.yaml). 

ToDos and decision points
1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a.  use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

There is SC24 news, we were recently contacted about the copyright release form for the BPHTE24 manuscript. This is in work, hopefully just a formality, but some US agencies have complicated processes.

The ISC (Hamburg) BoF [proposal](https://codimd.carpentries.org/-QmmnOIdQd-Sg4oODTJ-LA) is submitted. If it's accepted, we will have some logistical attendance issues to wrangle -- in the submission, Andrew said he would attend, becuase the submission workflow would not allow a non-attendee to submit.

From the Slack, the GW team (Clark Gaylord and Joseph Creech) have submitted a tutorial proposal for [PEARC25](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc25/).

We are also planning to put in for a BoF at this conference, the deadline is mid-March, 2025.


#### Actual Workshops

The NIST team got positive feedback from their abbreviated workshop, and now plan to repeat it in mid to late March at NIST's sister site in Colorado.


### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we hear anything.


#### The Website

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

<!-- old defunc location:
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#phase-2-incubation
-->

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/him), RWTH Aachen University
- Andrew Reid, NIST
- Martin Errenst (he/him), University of Wuppertal
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Jannetta Steyn
- Toby Hodges, The Carpentries
- Annaijat Alim Rasel
- Junaid Mir, University of Duisburg-Essen

### Preliminaries

Sidebar about getting the Google calendar link into Outlook. It seems that the link in the Codi is not always directly importable.

Also there are some action items, the Zoom link in the calendar is inconveniently placed, the obvious place to click goes to the map. Re-arranging the calendar so that the obvious clickable thing is the Zoom VTC link.

The Google calendar link might also not be in ics format?

### HPC Lesson Development

Try diving in to the Workbench and tinker with the snippet replacement?

Janetta Steyn is planning to run a workshop at the end of March, and is interested in using the Workbench version. Maybe start from the probable-pancake lesson?

Reach back out to Jean and get some read on the status? 

### Sidebar: Performance tuning

Martin Errenst: Is there content in the incubator that helps address performance optimization? Could we incorporate this?

The plan is to do workshops regularly, which will ultimately be "bring your own problem", but by way of intro, having a common starting point that might form the basis for a lesson would be valuable. 

But maybe this is advanced, and problem-specific? But we could teach about what metrics might be useful, teach about the "metrology" problem, e.g. run your job multiple times to get stats on run-times, that sort of thing.

The workflow lesson sort of nods in that direction, the diminishing returns of parallelization in Amdahl are in scope.

### Conferences and Outreach

#### Actual Conferences

Copyright release for the SC24 mansucript.

ISC BoF proposal is in, there are logistical issues surrounding who can attend. Marc-Andr√© is very likely to attend.

GW team submitted for PEARC25.

Maybe check in to SCAsia -- proposal deadlines are over. Annajiat is proposing a "Digital Scholarship Lab", looking for help with standing up a "miniature cluster" as a small part of the proposal. Maybe the Terraform and Magic Castle stuff? Also maybe Janetta's Mini-HPC?

#### Actual Workshops

NIST workshop in Boulder in March.

Janetta has a workshop coming up, March 11 and 12. Plan to run it as two separate days, shell on Day 1 and HPC Intro on Day 2, so people who already know the shell can skip Day 1. Thinking of doing shell as hybrid. Original plan was to run it on Mini-HPC, there were issues, but EESSI is working as of yesterday, so maybe it's alive after all?

Possible summer activities for NERSC and/or LLNL, conversation hasn't really started.

### Other Issues

#### NSF Cyber Training

No news.

#### The Website

No news.

#### Incubation

We are mostly doing the things. Having the workshop lessons settled, getting the workflow more properly into Beta, and getting the HPC Intro ported, is useful and important, and makes it easier for others to do workshops.

#### HPC Lesson Development

Recap of the early session. Reach out to Jean and see how to help.

#### Conferences and Outreach

Shared the SC24 and ISC news.

The PEARC proposal is in, Joseph will look into sharing the proposal text via Codi or some other means, since GW tools make it hard to share outside of GW.

Still planning to do a BoF at PEARC. 

GW PEARC25 Tutorial Submission:
<details>
    <summary>Click to expand</summary>
    
*High Performance Computing Introduction and Workflow Management Tutorial
Research Technology Services, The George Washington University*
    
The Research Technology Services team at The George Washington University propose to present a highly interactive hands-on High Performance Computing Introduction and Workflow Management Tutorial at PEARC25. The material is under development but we anticipate needing the full 6-hour allotment of a full-day Tutorial. 

In keeping with PEARC25‚Äôs theme ‚ÄúThe Power of Collaboration‚Äù, this tutorial demonstrates a method in which RCD support staff can collaborate with researchers to train them in HPC usage while receiving feedback to continually improve the training process and outreach efforts. The material in the official HPC Carpentry lesson curricula has been developed by RCD professionals of various backgrounds and is intended to help bring the RCD community together. 

We are working from several lessons in the HPC Carpentry curricula here: https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/community-lessons/#hpc-carpentry. In 2024 an expanded 2-day HPC Carpentry workshop was presented at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory two separate times: https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/blog/2024/08/llnl-workshop-blog-post.html. A similar 1-day workshop including material from the HPC Carpentry curricula was held at GW in October 2024: https://library.gwu.edu/events/introduction-high-performance-computing-gw-2024-10-15. Both of these workshops covered material that will be developed into the PEARC25 Tutorial we intend to present. Our final material will include live coding and participants running commands on their own laptops using remote resources that we will prepare for the tutorial. In the event of an extended internet outage in the session room, we will pivot the material to use resources local to each participant‚Äôs laptop (we can provide USB drives, etc). We intend to continue developing the tutorial material in collaboration with the HPC Carpentry community over the next few months. 

The format of the tutorial will consist of some introductory information including code of conduct, overview of the tutorial, and other administrative matters. The tutorial content itself will take the format of brief and focused lecturing, followed by the instructors demonstrating the related commands and functions alongside the participants performing the same tasks. The rest of the instructors and assistants will monitor the participants and provide one-on-one support. One of the foundational themes of Carpentries is ‚Äúno learner left behind‚Äù so questions and concerns from the tutorial participants are expected and encouraged. Another important aspect of our tutorial is to accommodate accessibility needs from the participants. 

The primary goal of the tutorial is for participants to learn something about basic HPC usage and Workflow Management and be able to apply that knowledge in their regular work. The HPC Carpentry community is always looking to grow its membership so we also hope to inspire participants in joining that community. Participants will be able to see what the Carpentry method of instruction can do in terms of their own teaching plans. 

We expect to be able to support a few dozen participants of Introductory experience level with Unix shell and/or command-line experience. Some basic familiarity with remote computing such as SSH and HPC are helpful. Our team of presenters is planned to include Joseph Creech, Adam Wong, and Clark Gaylord from GW as primary instructors, as well as Fong Banh and Rubeel Iqbal from GW providing administrative support. 

Our presenters will of course adhere to the PEARC Code of Conduct. The Carpentries community has its own code of conduct (https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/) and our presenters respect the importance of these safety guardrails. We also intend to use feedback mechanisms during and after the tutorial. The Carpentries promote values that align with and support DEI and inclusivity in general (https://carpentries.org/about-us/).

The relevance to ACM PEARC25 attendees is for novices to learn something new and for more advanced participants to gain more familiarity with the HPC Carpentry pedagogy and evaluate its instructional potential for the research community at their home institutions. 

Thank you for considering our proposal for PEARC25. We are excited for the opportunity to share it with the PEARC community if we are selected.
