# HPCC Meeting, May 15, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

1. Elections!
2. Workbench development (hpc-intro) needs a point person.
3. Conferences/Outreach
4. Workshops: Anybody have one upcoming? [Put it on the website!](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/upcoming-workshops/)
5. Other Issues In Flight

### Elections!

The incumbent Steering Committee has been seated far longer than 12 months. We should be deposed. Failing that, we are required to schedule an Election! Considerations:


There were a couple of action items from the [last meeting][last-meeting], one to draft an election plan for review, and one to review our announcement channels, including social media.

Social media channels now exist for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/hpc-carpentry.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@hpccarpentry), as well as a [gmail](mailto:hpc.carpentry.org@gmail.com) address, but they're not yet institutionally owned.

Does the election plan exist? 

### Workbench Development

Trevor replaced the Jekyll/Liquid syntax throughout Alan's fork of Toby's flattened HPC Intro lesson. It is available to [view](https://ocaisa.github.io/probable-pancake/) ([src](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake)).

The next step is to re-snippetize. If nobody else jumps at the opportunity, Trevor will create a default library for Slurm populated with generic replacements for proper nouns throughout. This can serve as the "fallback" configuration, over which site customizations may be laid. Another default for PBS/Torque, GridEngine, etc. can also be made, if there is any demand.

It remains relevant that [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

#### ToDos and decision points

0. Schedule a co-working session to resolve the logistical issues that came up last time.
1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a. use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

Andrew is planning to draft an abstract for USRSE, at least for a poster, and maybe for a talk. Talk deadline is May 16, poster deadline is in July sometime.

Are there other conference oppoertunities upcoming? SC25?

#### Actual Workshops

Planning continues for NERSC, the workshop will be June 11 and 12.

### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we are disappeared for mentioning DEI.

#### The Website

The Website is [failing to build](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/actions/runs/15025964986/job/42226682222), due to breakage in the cvmfs action.

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_room])

### Attendees

 - Andrew Reid (NIST)
 - Martin Errenst (University of Wuppertal / HPC.NRW)
 - Alan O'Cais (CECAM / University of Barcelona)
 - Trevor Keller (NIST)
 - Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (RWTH)
 - Georgios Kafanas (UNI LU)

### Elections!

For the immediate need, Trevor is writing up the legacy issue from the coordination repository that describes the [2023 process](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/124), the basic outline is to do nominations on the coordination repo and use ElectionBuddy for the actual election. The process will go on the governance page on the website, once it's written up.

The comment from the [last meeting][last-meeting] about liaising with the Carpentries is probably about the post-incubation state? Certainly that is the ultimate goal.

There are social media accounts, but they're not shared. It's easy to create an e-mail that redirects somewhere, but that just pushes the problem up a level.

Alan says there's a Gitlab Helpdesk thing that can receive e-mail and creates private-by-default issues, and is easy to scope, and also allows for the deletion of sensitive info and maintain confidentiality.

There is already an "HPC-Carpentry" group on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/hpc-carpentry), which several of us are already on. Alan will create a repo and set up the helpdesk thing, and we can redirect the e-mails to it.

### Workbench Development

Question about the status of this effort. The consensus is that it had reached the point where template substitution was working across all the lessons, and the next step was to implement the design for resource-manager and site customization.

Work is happening in [Alan's fork of probable pancake](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake).

The basic design is that there is an R script that handles things, including locating snippets and parsing configuration files. It's hierarchical, there's a base configuration file that always exists and is read first, and then there are "overlay" files, which don't have to exist, and if they exist don't have to be complete, which supersede the base configuration for the elements that they define. 

Alan's intent is that the overlay configurations should not define new elements.

There is [code that exists](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/load_config.R) that does this.

Bit of push-back -- Trevor thinks overlays should be allowed to define new elements, that's part of the point. This actually makes some sense if e.g. you define snippets that have templates that need substitution from the config, but if the snippet is non-default, the template might also be non-default, and the customization is in a narrower scope than the whole lesson.

Question from Andrew: This feels like it's combinatorially large and maybe a bad idea, should we instead have optional modules that are part of the base lesson, instead of snippets? Answer: Some existing snippets are fairly large, e.g. the EPCC version, but in that case, the snippets and customization are *both* site-specific, but they differ logistically, in their size and method of operation.

There's a danger of snippet inflation.

Path forward: Co-working session to focus on this -- Andrew will set this up. Homework for this is, participants should familiarize themselves with the current state of the [repo](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake), the first agenda item will be to hash out a design, clarifying the intended use of snippets vs variables, which hopefully will clarify the downstream technical issues.

This might happen on May 29? Except it's a holiday in Germany, so maybe not.

Sidebar: [There's a PR from TK to the repo](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake/pull/4) to untangle some of the dependencies.

### Conferences/Outreach

Toby did the UK RSE conference last week.

Andrew is likely to put in for a talk at USRSE, and will definitely put in for a poster at USRSE.

SC25? Maybe look in to SIGHPC Education again, or other opportunities.

Something we can talk about is the mechanics of creating content that's customizable.

### Workshops

Upcoming NIST workshop for the summer undergraduate students, also NERSC, which will be done remotely, June 11 and 12. (Not yet registered!)

Martin and Marc-Andre are planning a two or three day workshop, "All you need for computational research at NRW", similar to the CarpentriesConnect Heidelberg activity, with HPC being one of the topics. Not the stock program.

Alan says that Peter Steinbach approached him a while ago, and asked if "we" have capacity to do more of the HPC Intro workshops. Peter is involved in some AI thing in Germany, has money, and is looking to host some stuff. Not clear that we have capacity for this, but maybe Marc-Andre and/or Martin have some input? (It's "Helmoholtz AI", Peter is in Dresden.) Plans for a follow-up discussion.

### New Person!

Pinged about opening issues on the repo. Georgios Kafanas.

### Other Issues

Martin Errenst shared that his institution (HPC.NRW) is working on a related lesson in Workbench format about assessing the efficiency of HPC jobs, which might be useful to this project also.
