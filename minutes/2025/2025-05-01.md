# HPCC Meeting, May 1, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_room], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

1. Elections!
2. Workshop feedback
3. Workbench development (hpc-intro) needs a point person.
4. Lesson names
5. The Website
6. Workshops: Anybody have one upcoming? [Put it on the website!](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/upcoming-workshops/)
7. Lesson Program Incubation: how are we doing?

### Elections!

The incumbent Steering Committee has been seated far longer than 12 months. We should be deposed. Failing that, we are required to schedule an Election! Considerations:


There were a couple of action items from the last meeting, one to draft an election plan for review, and one to review our announcement channels, including social media.

Social media channels now exist for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/hpc-carpentry.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@hpccarpentry), as well as a [gmail](mailto:hpc.carpentry.org@gmail.com) address, but they're not yet institutionally owned.

Does the election plan exist? 

### Workshop Feedback

The NIST team had a workshop April 16 and 17, there is feedback.

One item of feedback was security-related -- the NIST IT security
folks objected to the lesson page being public, because it contained
the names of internal NIST systems. They're taken down now. 

The intersection of the usual Carpentries open workflow, 
the lesson localization, and NIST is a challenge!

### Workbench Development

Trevor replaced the Jekyll/Liquid syntax throughout Alan's fork of Toby's flattened HPC Intro lesson. It is available to [view](https://ocaisa.github.io/probable-pancake/) ([src](https://github.com/ocaisa/probable-pancake)).

The next step is to re-snippetize. If nobody else jumps at the opportunity, Trevor will create a default library for Slurm populated with generic replacements for proper nouns throughout. This can serve as the "fallback" configuration, over which site customizations may be laid. Another default for PBS/Torque, GridEngine, etc. can also be made, if there is any demand.

It remains relevant that [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

#### ToDos and decision points

0. Schedule a co-working session to resolve the logistical issues that came up last time.
1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a. use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Lesson Names

People who are not interested in parallel programming may (often?) see __HPC Intro__ and skip right past.
Might we come up with a name that better signals the course content, i.e., scheduler fundamentals?

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

Andrew drafted and submitted a PEARC25 BoF proposal (content's on [Codi](https://codimd.carpentries.org/DEIOJqIGTxiElw5jCakVcw)).

As of this writing, we have not heard back from PEARC.

#### Actual Workshops

Planning continues for NERSC, there's a meeting later today (May 1, 2025).

### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we are disappeared for mentioning DEI.

#### The Website

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_room])

### Attendees

- Andrew Reid, NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Toby Hodges (he/him), The Carpentries
- Jannetta Steyn, University of Newcastle
- Benson Muite

### Elections

For elections, we liked the platforms we used last time, we have an expectation of a June time-line for this, Trevor has agreed to set this up.

There are social media accounts, but they're not institutionally owned, but can maybe be hooked up with the domain. Andrew can/should reach out to Alan to connect with the domain. On the other hand, this might all be solved by the Carpentries once we are in the fold.

Question about the logistics of this? TBD, we'll be working with the Carpentries technical folks when the time comes.

### Workshop Feedback

#### NIST Boulder -- new instructor!

Steve Maxwell taught the HPC Intro lesson at NIST Boulder, including the FileZilla bits and other things we might usually skip.

FileZilla is an example of a graphical file browser, and might help with relieving the congnitive burden of not being able to immediately see the result of the command-line-based file transfer, which don't expose the file structure. FileZilla itself is a terrible tool, but file-system structure is important, and perhaps worth surfacing.

An alternative is Midnight Commander or other terminal-based file transfer tools, or even something like sftp. Maybe more emphasis on the data transfer episode? Or other tools, like VSCode or editors?

Apparently Data Carpentry does not do this, so we are breaking new ground.
Comment added later by Toby: Benson dug up the link to <https://datacarpentry.github.io/shell-genomics/05-writing-scripts.html#transferring-data-between-your-local-machine-and-the-cloud>, which does discuss this to some extent -- and limits things to command line tools

#### Security Issue

The combination of localization of the lesson page and the publication of it turned out to be a problem, and the localized lesson site was taken down at the request of the NIST OISM security folks.

The challenge to the model is that, for optics reasons, we want to catalog our activity in public -- when we advertise ourselves to conference organizers, we want this information out there so they can see that we are active. The path forward is to figure out how to do that in cases where hostnames can't be made public.

#### Cataloging Feedback

Do we have a repository for collecting the green and red stickies? 

Carpentries as a TypeForm-driven process that is built for this sort of thing, which can probably be leveraged for e.g. survey results. There's a potential technical problem with scope, it's not clear if it's possible to set up logins that restrict access to a sub-project or a specific workshop.
- Benson: Possibly useful are tools such as https://openformstack.com or some way of adding additional questions to typeform

For stickies, a Codi or something is a good answer, there's no pre-existing infrastructure that does that. They can inform a post-lesson debrief, which can then translate into repo issues, but after that the notes themselves are not high-value. Having a record of having done this is useful to the incubation process, of course.

### Workbench Development

[Last time][last-meeting], there was some discussion of the top-level config, this is on-going, no news.

### Lesson Names 

The term "HPC" can be intimidating. But this is what we do, so the solution is to get the content out there and educate the community as to the level of expertise required to engage with the content. The project and lesson names are hard to change at this point, but we can also maybe clarify the scope in the rendered lesson and in the publicity materials.

In advertisements, calling it "Cluster computing" is easier for people to digest.

### Conferences/Outreach

#### Conferences 

PEARC turned us down.

UK-RSE abstracts are due tomorrow. Toby might submit something for Jannetta to present? 10-min talk on what we've done so far. Could recycle the sigHPCed talk or outline (useful data compilation).

[US-RSE (Philadelphia, October) is due 15 May](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/). Toby proposes a Poster submission outlining Incubation and how it's going. Maybe better next year, when it's a retrospective?

Perhaps we should draft a Propaganda Poster to have in hand and plaster in the alleyways.

#### Workshops

NERSC. Call later today. Ping Toby when we have dates.

### Other Issues

FileZilla: a graphical filesystem transfer tool, showing the layout of files on the local & remote machine, might reduce the cognitive load; or, we should spend more time exercising tools we have already introduced.

This is also relevant for
- https://datacarpentry.github.io/shell-genomics/05-writing-scripts.html#transferring-data-between-your-local-machine-and-the-cloud
- https://datacarpentry.github.io/cloud-genomics/02-logging-onto-cloud.html

For shell intro, some people have one drive issues, so maybe adding a remote section is useful but it wouldlengthen the lesson:
- https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/pull/1480

## 17:00 EST Session ([VTC][zoom_room])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Sam Corey (MIT)

### Sidebar

Intro to Sam Corey, who has been a researcher-facing HPC support role at MIT, they are engaging with the Carpentries to help improve instruction broadly.

Ranted to him about our project and mission.

He's not looking for anything in particular from us.

Q: What is the starting point of people who come to him/his team for support with HPC Development?
A: It's not super-frequent, but they are already developers, but are new to modules and are surprised and disappointed by not having root access.

Q: GPUs? A: Not active right now.

### Elections

Coming soon.

### Workshop Feedback

Summarized this.

### Workbench Development

### Lesson Name

Not addressed.

### Conferences/Outreach

General overview of our efforts and constraints.
