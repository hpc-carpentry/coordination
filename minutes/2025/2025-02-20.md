# HPCC Meeting, February 20, 2025

The HPC Carpentry Steering Committee hosts meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month, with two time slots intended to provide adequate coverage for our global constituency. These two meeting times provide the least-painful coverage for the six non-polar continents. Folks in Antarctica and aboard a space station are invited to join whichever is most convenient.

* [13:00 CET][earlier] &mdash; on [Zoom Room 2][zoom_early], better for Africa, Asia, and Europe  
  Meeting ID: 824 315 0376, Passcode: 202020
* [17:00 EST][evening] &mdash; on [Zoom Room ~~3~~ 2][zoom_early], better for the Americas and Oceania  
  Meeting ID: 271 847 9229, Passcode: 202020

A Google calendar has been set up to capture these events, available [online][gcal] and for [download][ical] for your calendar app.

Here is a [Checklist of HPC Carpentry's Lesson Program Incubation Tasks][hpc-lpi-list].

---

## Agenda

1. Workbench development (hpc-intro) needs a point person.
2. ACCESS allocation
3. PEARC deadline? (We intend to submit an abstract.)
4. Workshops: NERSC/LLNL? Anybody have one upcoming? [Put it on the website!](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/upcoming-workshops/)
5. 

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

This item is mostly unchanged since the [last meeting][last-meeting]. 

One salient fact is [announced changes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/) to what the Carpentries Infrastructure will support -- `__styles__` support ends Dec. 31, 2025.  That's a ways off, but worth noting.

If there has not been recent progress, then the relevant agenda topic is how to better support this effort.

#### History

Jean's fork of Toby's flattened [HPC Intro](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) can be found at https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake.  

There are three instances of the Scheduler episode. In the [original](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-scheduler.md)), the flattened snippet looks like ``{{ site.remote.prompt }}``. The [EPCC instance](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-epcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-epcc-scheduler.Rmd)) took the EPCC version of that episode from the EPCC repo and showed their snippet strategy worked (same snippet now has format \`r config\$remote\$prompt\`) with a slightly tweaked instance of EPCC's [yaml config](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/epcc_config.yaml). Finally, an [HPCC version](https://jlchang.github.io/probable-pancake/13-hpcc-scheduler.html) ([source](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/13-hpcc-scheduler.Rmd)) using the EPCC Scheduler episode content and HPCC snippets that has the values for HPCC snippets into [lesson_config.yaml](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake/blob/main/episodes/lesson_config.yaml). 

ToDos and decision points
1. Determine if this snippet strategy should accommodate scheduler-specific snippets in addition to site-specific snippets (educated guess: can provide scheduler-specific yaml files to guide lesson customization)
2. Decide if the repo should contain 
    a. many locale-specific snippet files (ie. retain existing pre-flattened repo structure) OR
    b. just one (or a core set if providing scheduler-specific examples) to guide local customization (ie. customized file stays in local repo).
3. What, if any, content merging between current HPC Intro and EPCC repo
    a.  use EPCC as "base" file (ie. take advantage of EPCC content with already-formatted snippets and back-port/revert differing content) OR 
    b. work through each HPC Intro episode and convert to R markdown (requires adjusting some non-snippet hyperlinks) and adjust old snippets to new format (defer decisons on integrating EPCC content)

By way of reminder, the goal is to migrate the [HPC Intro][hpc-intro] lesson to the Carpentries Workbench. There's a [shared document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/e-TnbrTaRSSAFXhGILr6NQ) with notes about how this is done in the EPCC world. As of Sept. 27, what had happened was, a [flattened version](https://github.com/tkphd/hpc-intro-online) had been created, then [migrated to the workbench](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake) using the automatic migration tool (thanks Toby!).

### Conferences and Outreach

Broadly speaking, we should probably have a conversation about the goals of the outreach efforts. These certainly include raising awareness of our efforts in the broader community, but also, what is our "ask" of the community? Do we want new instructors? People to ask us to do workshops? Sites or people to do workshops without us?

#### Actual Conferences

From the Slack, the GW team (Clark Gaylord and Joseph Creech) have submitted a tutorial proposal for [PEARC25](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc25/).

We are also planning to put in for a BoF at this conference, the deadline is March 22, 2025.


#### Actual Workshops

The NIST team got positive feedback from their abbreviated workshop, and now plan to repeat it in mid to late March at NIST's sister site in Colorado.


### Other Issues In Flight

#### NSF CyberTraining Program Grant Application

Toby and Erin Becker (Carpentries) worked with Trevor (HPCC) on a proposal in response to the NSF [call for funding](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced) for advanced cyberinfrastructure training, which sounds a whole lot like what we do.

This proposal made it in under the deadline, we expect it will take several months before we hear anything.


#### The Website

(Unchanged from Jan. 2025)

Consensus about the website from the [July 4 meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/VMqdWq7ISNiZVMQWE9OSWA) (!!) was that the website needs attention, but that we'll want to align with the revised Carpentries styling once that settles down,

Possibly a draft design or a review of the desired content might still be appropriate -- this is our "front door", and will be a natural focus of attention as we do more outreach.

Items from AT:

- Some open issues that should be addressed -> [clarify core curriculum](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79), [clarify lesson maintainers](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/78)
- I agree with [#79](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/issues/79) that the lessons page is very difficult to parse. Clarifying the core HPC Carpentry curriculum (and the status of its lessons) would help. I'd recommend mirroring the structure of SWC (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Are there designated website owners/maintainers responsible for updating/approving MRs? Could make this clear on the website e.g. on https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/maintainers/ -> list lesson maintainers & website maintainers
- It's not clear who is in charge of the group (the [governance site](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/governance/) just links to a GH issue) -> a list of steering committee members and any affiliated orgs would be useful here.
- There are a number of issues which look stale, these should be triaged and either closed/assigned
- There is a stale MR ([steering committee charter](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-carpentry.github.io/pull/73)) which might need attention


### Carpentries Incubation

As a reminder, the [full set of nominal requirements are in the Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-programs.html#phase-2-incubation)  (WP: link updated for the new Carpentries Handbook website)

Also, these requirements are re-cast in the form of [several issues](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/projects/1/views/2) on the coordination repo.

These need to be broken down into actionable pieces, and some sense of progress arrived at. We are doing a fair amount of outreach, and doing some workshops, and some development, but maybe losing our grip on the big picture. 

As a first cut, for this session, we should generate a list of the areas which are getting the least attention, or maybe the least effective attention. The goal for today is not necessarily to break them down entirely into actionable pieces (thought that would be awesome), but to remind ourselves of what there is to do.

## 13:00 CET Session([VTC][zoom_early])

### Participants

- Andrew Reid, NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Marc-Andr√© Hermanns (he/his), RWTH Aachen University
- Alan O'Cais, UB/CECAM

### HPC Intro Lesson Development

Jean Chang is abandoning her effort to migrate HPC Intro to the workbench. The best starting point to go forward is Toby's [probable pancake](https://github.com/tobyhodges/probable-pancake), with reference to Jean's [fork](https://github.com/jlchang/probable-pancake).

Alan had a look at whether it was possible to render the lesson into Markdown that can then be translated, but this turns out to be a high bar. What Jean has done is somewhat legible, so we are not all the way back to Toby's repo.

Idea: Do a co-working call to get this into a better state, and maybe hack up something that's usable in the near term? We still have the idea of a sort of cascading set of configs, which hopefully will not be combinatorially complicated.

Co-working session for this, 13:00 CET Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Venue to be determined.

### Conferences and Outreach

Extending the ACCESS allocation -- Alan has shared the relevant documents from the prior renewal, and was expecting someone else could submit. There's a private hpc-carpentry repository for the machinery that brings up the cluster, it's up to date and was used in December. It talks to the Terraform Cloud, where Alan has credentials, so that's a path forward for this. Terraform Cloud is used to bring the nodes up and down on demand for SLURM, which helps with making efficient use of the resrouce.

For PEARC, the BoF deadline is March 22, "we" (Andrew) still plan to put in a proposal for this.

Toby and Marc-Andr√© are up for a session at deRSE on identifying Carpentries instructors.

Link to new ["Identifying HPC Carpentry Instructors"](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gSbYlyIJb-RM3UH2qx6F4xQkdy1vO1OajjQIuxipVSA/edit?pli=1) form.

ISC is still in flight, expecting news next week (Feb. 24).

Still pending: Outreach to the NERSC folks to see about summer workshops, and/or LLNL.

### Other Issues

#### NSF

No news (nor was it expected tbh) about the NSF CyberInfrastructure training.

#### The Website

No news. The plan remains to harmonize the design with the other lesson programs as much as possible.

### Carpentries Incubation

Moving the needle on the prior items is part of this. We are hopeful that the on-boarding and instructor identification emphasis in ISC will help with this.

## 17:00 EST Session ([VTC][zoom_early]) -- note room! Same as the early session, different from the usual.

### Participants

- Andrew Reid (he/him), NIST
- Trevor Keller (they/them), NIST
- Stephen Maxwell, NIST 
- Joseph Creech, GW


### HPC Intro Development

Reprised the early session.

### Conferences and Outreach

The GW folks put in for a tutorial at PEARC, have not yet heard back.

Extending the ACCESS allocation? Joseph doesn't know what's up with that. There's a JetStream2 workshop on March 6, which might be interesting, came around on the CARC mailing list, maybe? Mentioned the Terraform Cloud thing.


### Other Issues in Flight

NSF proposal, no news.

The website needs attention at some point.

### Incubation

As in the early session -- we are doing the things, we think. A review to verify this might be in order.
