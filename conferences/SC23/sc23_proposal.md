#### Abstract

The HPC Carpentry project is a community-based organization focused on a set of lessons for introducing novice users from diverse communities to high-performance computing resources, including queuing systems, shared filesystems, and understanding scaling in parallel processing. Following the pedagogical model of The Carpentries, our material is presented in a workshop setting where learners code along with instructors to build muscle memory and develop an understanding of fundamental tasks on HPC clusters. We have recently developed a two-day workshop, and are seeking feedback from the broader community of HPC users and administrators on the scope, clarity, and applicability of the workshop to diverse HPC environments.

#### Long Description

The HPC Carpentry initiative is a community-based project that relies on volunteers to create, manage and deliver a set of instructional materials for novice users of HPC systems from a wide variety of backgrounds. As HPC resources become more widely available, a skills gap has opened up, where many projects that can now afford access to HPC systems are not able to use them effectively. HPC systems depend very strongly on legacy interfaces to computing, such as command-line interfaces and batch scripting, which may not be familiar even to computational scientists who are experts in the world of desktop applications.

Our materials and organization meet this need through the pedagogical techniques of The Carpentries, which has had considerable success teaching novice learners foundational lessons on the Unix shell, Python, R and Git in a workshop setting, where learners code along in real-time with instructors. The workshop setting provides a rich educational experience in a relatively short amount of time, and the interactive approach helps learners build up muscle memory for the tasks involved while quickly resolving questions and misconceptions that arise. Learners cannot be made into experts in the workshop time frame, but can get a feel for how the material being taught is supposed to work and revisit the lessons long after the workshop has concluded. Following the Carpentries example, our lessons are open-source, and we collect pre- and post-workshop information from instructors and learners to help execute continuous improvement on the material. 

Our relationship with the Carpentries is not purely one of emulation -- we are working towards becoming an official lesson program, alongside the existing Software, Data, and Library Carpentries, and our lessons have recently entered incubator status. We also strongly affirm the Carpentries' commitment to a positive learning environment that is respectful of learners and contributors from many backgrounds and all parts of the world.

We had a successful BoF at SC'21 which was focused on community feedback with regard to our curriculum priorities, which we have used to refine lesson materials and develop the two-day workshop outline. Entering The Carpentries' Lesson Program Incubator provides us with greater visibility, and highlights the challenges associated with teaching a single curriculum relevant to the wide range of different HPC architectures that exist in the world. Constructively engaging with this challenge involves recruiting instructors to host our workshops at a broader spectrum of computing facilities, listening to the real-world experiences of instructors and learners, and growing in directions of greatest need. For this BoF, we are looking to expand our community of instructors and contributors by demonstrating the values and adaptability of our content and organization.

#### Format Information

We propose to run the BoF in two parts. The first part will be a brief introduction to the project, its relationship to The Carpentries, the live-coding pedagogical technique, and the mechanics of setting up a workshop for a particular HPC resource. The second part will be a guided discussion with the audience, where the session leaders will pose questions about the HPC community's needs for workshop support, and solicit community feedback to assess and improve the practicality of preparing a workshop for people outside the HPC Carpentry development team.
