### Unix Shell

1. Excellent instructor. Excellent in-person classroom setup.
2. good overview of bash shel, comments regarding coding based on experience
3. Good amount of examles, has a nice build and gives great alternative commands
4. Became aware of how bash tools could really help my data processing
5. The session expanded my awareness of what bash commands can do
6. Expert knowledge was great
7. Great examples
8. Very clear presentation, learned some useful tips despite using bash every day

### HPC Intro

1. Great job! So happy to see this course grow. _Keep it going._ 1½ days is a
   good time frame.
2. Clarity of presentation was great! Very useful to have Teams chat available
   (with helpers & admins).
3. Great examples and scripts in the lesson. Very nice basic Slurm knowledge in
   the lesson.
4. This was all new, and __I feel better about trying HPC now__, even outside
   Blackbird.
5. Very helpful!

### Unix Shell

1. Split Shell and HPC Intro into separate training sessions.
2. In the scope of HPC, I personally do not think we need this much on Shell.
   My preference would be 1½ hours on 1st day for Shell, then move on to
   HPC. I'd leave full Shell for an SWC workshop.
3. Having a simple "if you already know how to do XYZ, you can skip this bit"
   might be nice, especially to know if we could have skipped the first day.
4. Print out or list of commands for participants
5. `tree -L 1` might be a godo visual intro to the filesystem
6. Split screen -- can see outcome and script at the same time
7. An entire session on regex would apply to a lot of situations
8. Walk through a realistic process for data management prior to using graphing software
9. Have hourly topic sessions so people can pick and choose
10. Better/tighter integration w/online notes, course materials, etc would be good.
11. I think ending on how to make a bash script executable w/ bash aliases would be better
12. Less files to switch between lik I think most examples could work with alkanes and animals files
13. Give people the option to skip the 1st portion of the day if comfortable w/bash, but I would not cut out because some might not be familiar w/bash
14. More hands-on practice, could be faster in the first period

### HPC Intro

1. I think even in an intro course, it would be good to discuss and play with
   OpenMP. Less Shell.
2. Having the commands available to copy and paste, rather than copying off the
   screen, might help. Several times I was copying text and missed what was
   said.
3. Sometimes it was tricky to type along, but this was all new to me. Jargon
   intro was good but I still got a bit lost. Touch on GPU commands if they're
   different.
4. To save time and to cover more parts, already made scripts could be used
   instead of writing scripts live.
