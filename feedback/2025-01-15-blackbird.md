# Workshop Feedback: 2025-01-15-blackbird

### Unix Shell

1. Excellent instructor. Excellent in-person classroom setup.

### HPC Intro

1. Great job! So happy to see this course grow. _Keep it going._ 1½ days is a
   good time frame.
2. Clarity of presentation was great! Very useful to have Teams chat available
   (with helpers & admins).
3. Great examples and scripts in the lesson. Very nice basic Slurm knowledge in
   the lesson.
4. This was all new, and __I feel better about trying HPC now__, even outside
   Blackbird.
5. Very helpful!

### Unix Shell

1. Split Shell and HPC Intro into separate training sessions.
2. In the scope of HPC, I personally do not think we need this much on Shell.
   My preference would be 1½ hours on 1st day for Shell, then move on to
   HPC. I'd leave full Shell for an SWC workshop.
3. Having a simple "if you already know how to do XYZ, you can skip this bit"
   might be nice, especially to know if we could have skipped the first day.

### HPC Intro

1. I think even in an intro course, it would be good to discuss and play with
   OpenMP. Less Shell.
2. Having the commands available to copy and paste, rather than copying off the
   screen, might help. Several times I was copying text and missed what was
   said.
3. Sometimes it was tricky to type along, but this was all new to me. Jargon
   intro was good but I still got a bit lost. Touch on GPU commands if they're
   different.
4. To save time and to cover more parts, already made scripts could be used
   instead of writing scripts live.
