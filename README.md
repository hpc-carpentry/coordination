# Coordinating HPC Carpentry

This repository serves as a centralizing location for documents / notes / information re: HPC Carpentry 
[HPC Carpentry organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry) that isn't contained on the general website. 

## Current status of HPC Carpentry

"Beta" lessons are available in the [HPC Carpentry organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry).

Anyone is welcome to use and modify these materials.  If you want to run a workshop called "HPC Carpentry" 
please see the suggested guidelines on the [HPC Carpentry about page](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/about). 

Anyone is welcome to submit pull requests modifying the current lessons.

If you're interested in becoming a lesson maintainer (reviewing issues and pull requests on the lesson material 
repositories), open an issue on the relevant lesson repository.  

HPC Carpentry isn't really a formal "organization" as such.  We're trying to work out a process where 
decisions are made about what happens next with the lessons.  Staying on the [discussion list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-hpc)
is the best way to stay connected to that process.  

## Open Issues

* Starting a monthly meeting for people to chat, ask questions, discuss what's happening with HPC Carpentry; 
notes will probably be in this repository.  
* Incorporating the "templating" in @psteinb's fork to make it easy to switch schedulers (start w/ 2-3 for default)
* Adding new lessons (what process / how are they included)
* Confirm/finalize process for adding lesson maintainers
